The vocals of beautiful crystalline melodies of Sabrina Valentine are uniquely set in a furious power/thrash metal attack- blended with epic choirs and the occasional brute growls of the men of S.K.  Shortly after Seven Kingdoms played the opening party at ProgPower USA and was then hand picked by legendary German power metal band- Blind Guardian- as opener for their 2010 North American tour which saw the band playing in front of thousands of metal fans throughout North America- solidifying a foothold in Metal. Seven Kingdoms went on to play several one off's and smaller tours in 2011 ending with the ""Uniting The Powers Of Metal tour"" also receiving endorsements from Engl Amplification and Warwick Basses / Amps.  In May of 2012 the band entered Morrisound Studios to creating a record powerful enough to hang with the best in metal. With Jim Morris at the helm and much more experience gained- Seven Kingdoms created their next melodic power thrash opus  ""A band started for fun- found that hard work and dedication to your craft has it's major pay offs... Seven Kingdoms is carving its own path in metal history creating something genuinely unique- yet undeniably METAL with their latest and greatest album.""  Track Listing:    01. Beyond The Wall    02.

It was her biggest moment in music- making her self-titled debut a definite part of the feel-good disco scene of the late '70s. The blues-tinged ""Diamond in the Rough"" and ""Broken Woman"" were mildly successful- but Bridges never regained her disco reign. Two more albums followed -- 1979's Play It as It Lays and 1984's Hocus Pocus -- but those failed to gain recognition despite some disco threads transitioning into the new wave scene of the early '80s.

Eric Clapton | Riding With The King ( official video and lyrics),"I dreamed I had a good job and I got well paid.  I blew it all at the penny arcade.  A hundred dollars on a kewpie doll.  No pretty chick is gonna make me crawl.   Get on a TWA to the promised land.  Every woman- child and man  Gets a Cadillac and a great big diamond ring.  Don't you know you're riding with the king?   He's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier-  He's gonna check us all on out of here.  Up to that mansion on a hill  Where you can get your prescription filled.   Get on a TWA to the promised land.  Everybody clap your hands.  And don't you just love the way that he sings?  Don't you know we're riding with the king?  Riding with the king.  Don't you know we're riding with the king?   A tuxedo and shiny 335.  You can see it in his face- the blue never lie.  Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings.  And don't you know we're riding with the king?   I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old  With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a heart made of gold.  I had a guitar hanging just about waist high  And I'm gonna play this thing until the day I die.   Don't you know we're riding with the king?  Don't you know we're riding with the king?  Riding- you're riding with the king.  You're riding- you're riding with the king.  Riding with the King was the first collaborative album by Eric Clapton and B.B. King.[1][2] They performed together for the first time at Cafe Au Go Go in New York City in 1967 when Clapton was 22 and a member of Cream- but did not record together until 1997 when King collaborated with Clapton on the song ""Rock Me Baby"" for his duets album- Deuces Wild.[3][4] Clapton looked up to King and had always wanted to make an album with him.[3] King said they had discussed the project often- and added: ""I admire the man. I think he's No. 1 in rock 'n' roll as a guitarist and No. 1 as a great person.""[3] At the time of recording Riding with the King- Clapton was 55 and King 74. Clapton initiated the recording sessions for Riding with the King and included some of his regular session musicians on the album. He also chose the songs and co-produced the album with Simon Climie- who had previously worked on several of Clapton's albums.[1] While this would appear to be a Clapton album recorded with King- Clapton gave King center-stage- who took the lead on many of the songs with his singing and his solos.[5] The album contains five ""vintage"" King songs from the 1950s and 1960s: ""Ten Long Years""- ""Three O'Clock Blues""- ""Help the Poor""- ""Days of Old"" and ""When My Heart Beats Like a Hammer"".[3] Other standards include the Big Bill Broonzy-penned ""Key to the Highway"" (which Clapton had recorded in the early 1970s with Derek and the Dominos)- Chicago pianist Maceo Merriweather's ""Worried Life Blues""- a cover of Isaac Hayes's composition ""Hold On- I'm Comin'"" originally a 1966 single for Sam & Dave- and ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" from the 1946 musical St. Louis Woman. The balance of the tracks were written especially for the album.[1] The tracks are a mixture of acoustic (""Worried Life Blues"") and electric songs (""Three O'Clock Blues"")- and vary from slow numbers (""Ten Long Years"") to ""mid-tempo stomps"" (""Help the Poor"").[6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_with_the_King_(B._B._King_and_Eric_Clapton_album)",107,1491,17,191397,nullB.B.

King is the greatest living exponent of the blues and considered by many to be the most influential guitarist of the latter part of the 20th century. His career dates back to the late forties and despite now being in his eighties he remains a vibrant and charismatic live performer. B.B. King has been a frequent visitor to the Montreux festival, appearing nearly 20 times, so choosing one performance was no easy task. This 1993 concert will surely rank as one of his finest at any venue. With a superb backing band and a great set list its a must for any blues fan.The thrill is goneThe thrill is gone awayThe thrill is gone babyThe thrill is gone awayYou know you done me wrong babyAnd you'll be sorry somedayThe thrill is goneIt's gone away from meThe thrill is gone babyThe thrill is gone away from meAlthough, I'll still live onBut so lonely I'll beThe thrill is goneIt's gone away for goodThe thrill is gone babyIt's gone away for goodSomeday I know I'll be open armed babyJust like I know a good man shouldYou know I'm free, free now babyI'm free from your spellOh I'm free, free, free nowI'm free from your spellAnd now that it's all overAll I can do is wish you wel",8543,55402,1171,13993573,nullB.J.

A sound that began steeped in the 4/4 dance tradition- slowly took on hip hop tendencies until the two became one. Influenced heavily by southern hip-hop and UK bass sounds- Baauer has found himself smack dab in the middle of the electronic renaissance. He is the delectable fusion of future-crunk and leather shaken aggressively in a bottle for years and has only just opened the top to pour the mixture out.  Harlem Shake his been featured on almost every Diplo and Friends mix to date including Diplo- Brodinski- and Flosstradamus as well as being featured in Rustie's Lastest Essential mix!

The group comprised Jimmy McShane (frontman/vocals)- Maurizio Bassi (keyboards- vocals)- Giorgio Cocilovo (lead guitar)- Claudio Bazzari (rhythm guitar)- Pier Michelatti (bass guitar) and Gabriele Melotti (drums). They are best known for their 1985 hit single ""Tarzan Boy"".  Jimmy McShane- from Derry in Northern Ireland- was the frontman of the group. Lead vocals were performed by Maurizio Bassi (with Jimmy actually providing the backing vocals)- including lead vocals on their biggest hit ""Tarzan Boy"" despite the fact that McShane lip synched while appearing in the ""Tarzan Boy"" music video and not Bassi- who was also the group's keyboardist.[1] Both the music and the lyrics of Baltimora were written mostly by Bassi and Naimy Hackett- though McShane wrote the lyrics to some of their songs- such as the single ""Survivor in Love"".  Baltimora are often considered a one-hit wonder in the United Kingdom and the United States due to the success they experienced with ""Tarzan Boy"" compared to their other singles.

Mann's version did not chart in the UK- though a cover version by the Viscounts reached # 21 there in September- 1961- and another version by Showaddywaddy charted at # 37 in August- 1982.    ""Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp- Bomp- Bomp)"" is a Doo-wop style hit song from 1961 co-written (with Gerry Goffin) and recorded by Barry Mann. He was backed up by The Halos- who had previously backed up Curtis Lee on the song ""Pretty Little Angel Eyes"". The song was originally released as a single on the ABC-Paramount label (10237).    In this song- Mann sings about the frequent use of nonsense lyrics in Doo-Wop music- and how his girl fell in love with him after listening to several of such songs.    Examples of the type of song referred to include the Marcels' version of ""Blue Moon"" (in which they sing ""Bomp bomp ba bomp- ba bomp ba bomp bomp"" and ""dip-de-dip-de-dip"") and the Edsels' ""Rama-Lama-Ding-Dong""- both of which charted earlier the same year.    The song inspired the title of a music magazine- called ""Who Put the Bomp"".    The song fits into the category of ""self-referential"" songs. Rock songs are often about rock (We're gonna rock around the clock)- reggae songs about reggae- rap songs about rap- etc. In this particular song that aspect is accentuated by the fact that Mann is a songwriter singing about songwriters.    It is also an ironic- lightly self-mocking song. This is a frequent phenomenon in popular music- M's ""Pop Muzik"" being an example (Wikipedia).",1040,8248,151,2054658,nullBarry Mann,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlz89zqlw_k,hlz89zqlw_k,Linda Ronstadt & Barry Mann - Somewhere Out There-Live,Linda and the man that composed her hit  included in the famous film Fievel and the New World.

""Body and Soul"" is a popular jazz song featured on Billie Holidays album with the same title. ""Body and Soul"" was written in New York City for the British actress and singer Gertrude Lawrence. It was first performed in London by her. It was first published in England. Libby Holman introduced it in the U.S. in the 1930 Broadway revue Three's a Crowd. Louis Armstrong was the first jazz musician to record ""Body and Soul"". The tune grew quickly in popularity- and by the end of 1930 at least eleven groups had recorded it. ""Body and Soul"" remains a jazz standard- with hundreds of versions performed and recorded by dozens of artists.   Tony Bennett recorded the classic pop standard Body And Soul- with Amy Winehouse at Abbey Road Studios in London March- 2011. The duet proceeds will be donated to her charity ""The Amy Winehouse Foundation.""  One of the most famous and influential takes was recorded by Coleman Hawkins and His Orchestra on October 11- 1939- at their only recording session for Bluebird- a subsidiary of RCA Victor. The recording is unusual in that the song's melody is only hinted at in the recording; Hawkins' two-choruses of improvisation over the tune's chord progression constitute almost the entire take. Because of this- as well as the imaginative use of harmony and break from traditional swing cliches- the recording is recognised as part of the ""early tremors of bebop"". In 2004- the Library of Congress entered it into the National Recording Registry  To this day- ""Body and Soul"" is the most recorded jazz standard.  ""Dedicated To You"" is a song written by Sammy Cahn- Saul Chaplin- Hy Zaret.  The first recording was by Andy Kir and His Clouds of Joy in 1936.  Sarah Lois Vaughan (March 27- 1924 -- April 3- 1990) was an American jazz singer- described by Scott Yanow as having ""one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century."" Nicknamed ""Sailor"" (for her salty speech)- ""Sassy"" and ""The Divine One""- Sarah Vaughan was a Grammy Award winner. The National Endowment for the Arts bestowed upon her its ""highest honor in jazz""- the NEA Jazz Masters Award- in 1989.  William Clarence Eckstine (July 8- 1914 -- March 8- 1993) was an American singer of ballads and a bandleader of the swing era. Eckstine's smooth baritone and distinctive vibrato broke down barriers throughout the 1940s- first as leader of the original bop big-band- then as the first romantic black male in popular music. Eckstine's recording of ""I Apologize-"" MGM Pop Single- (1948) was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999.",47,418,8,78595,nullBilly Idol,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCZuYS-9qaw,NCZuYS-9qaw,Billy Idol - Cradle Of Love,Official video of Billy Idol performing Cradle Of Love from the album Charmed Life.

They didn't only become known for their rough- smoky Hoogoven-born sound- but also for the great number of changes in their line-up. In the 1960s- especially in the province of Noord-Holland- they had a firm following- which- in the cities of Beverwijk and Haarlem- manifested itself in posters plastered on many walls and even a gigantic gas tank with their name painted on it. Although only one original member remains in the band now (Frank Kraayeveld- b- v) and they have split up a few times along the way- the Bintangs (Indonesian for ""stars"") are one of the (if not the) longest-lasting bands in the Netherlands.    Key members throughout the years were - apart from Frank Kraayeveld - his younger brother Arti (g- v and principal songwriter) and Mick Jagger-soundalike Guus (or Gus) Pleines (v- h). After just two hits- Arti and Frank left The Bintangs in late 1970 and formed Kraayeveld (later renamed Circus Kraayeveld). In 1974- Gus Pleines joined Kraayeveld from the then-defunct Bintangs- but in 1975 they changed their name to Bintangs again. Arti had already left Kraayeveld in June 1973 (replaced by younger brother Ren_ Kraayeveld) and formed Carlsberg. Gus Pleines was the lead singer between 1968-1983 and 1989-2004. He died in 2007. The band officially split up in 1985 with Frank forming The Frank Kraayeveld Band.

The group was formed in Tampa- FL- in 1966 by Michael Pinera (b. September 29- 1948- Tampa- FL) (guitar- vocals)- Manuel Bertematti (b. 1946- Tampa- FL) (percussion)- and Joe Lala (b. Tampa- FL) (drums). Malcolm Jones (b. Cardiff- Wales) (bass) joined in 1966- followed in 1968 by Frank ""Skip"" Konte (b. Canyon City- OK) (keyboards). The band moved to New York City in 1968 and managed a club called the Image. Then they moved to Los Angeles- where they signed to Atlantic Records' Atco division in February 1969- and released their self-titled debut album. This was followed by Open (1970)- which featured ""Ride Captain Ride."" But the Blues Image never followed their hit. Pinera left- replaced by Kent Henry (guitar) and Dennis Correll (vocals). Then the Blues Image broke up. A third album- Red White & Blues Image- was compiled from outtakes. Skip Konte joined Three Dog Night- while some other band members reformed as Manna. Pinera later was a member of Iron Butterfly- then Ramatam- and- with Bertematti- the New Cactus Band. He also formed a band called Thee Image and worked as a solo artist. Lala became a Los Angeles session player and worked with Joe Walsh and the various manifestations of Crosby- Stills- Nash & Young- among others.   ~ William Ruhlmann- All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

He was born in Nacogdoches- Texas- and grew up loving both sports and music. As a teen- Luman was a high school baseball star- and was so good that he caught the eye of several major league baseball scouts. Through his teens- Luman was primarily interested in singing country music like his idol Lefty Frizzell- but then he saw Elvis perform at a country music show. This inspired him to try his hand at the rockabilly sound and found his own band- which soon began performing at school activities and for area clubs. Soon after graduating- Luman won a talent contest- leading to his debut on the Louisiana Hayride. He was well received and became a regular in the mid-'50s. He was handsome- young and talented to boot- so it was only natural that Luman begin appearing on television. In 1957- he had a small role in a Hollywood film- Carnival Rock. He also appeared in Las Vegas along with Tex Ritter and Johnny Cash. Still- his singles did nothing on the charts.   In 1959- the Pittsburgh Pirates offered young Luman a lucrative contract. Fed up with his lack of success- he decided to go for it and announced this during a concert one night. The Everly Brothers happened to be in the audience and after the show- they talked him into giving country music one more try. They suggested he record the Boudleaux Bryant song ""Let's Think About Living-"" and sure enough- it was a Top Ten hit on both the country and pop charts. His follow-up- ""The Great Snowman-"" was also a hit and Luman began organizing a promotional tour. Unfortunately he was drafted and spent the next two years in the military.He was discharged in 1964 and began recording for Hickory Records.   His debut single- ""The File-"" made it to the Top 25. The following year- he became a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Luman eventually signed with Epic Records and soon had a string of major hits on his hands beginning with the Top 20 ""Ain't Got Time to Be Happy."" Over the next ten years- Luman released many more singles that made it into the Top 25 or better- including the Top Five hit ""Lonely Women Make Good Lovers"" in 1972. During these years- Luman toured extensively and frequently. The first country performer to perform in Puerto Rico- he also appeared on national and international television shows and remained a regular on the Opry- where his lively performances raised the eyebrows of the old timers who thought his music veered dangerously close to rock & roll at times. Luman had a major heart attack in 1975- and it took him nearly five months to recover. (Afterwards- he joked about his enormous medical bills during his Opry performances.) His final chart appearance came in 1977 with the Top 15 hit ""The Pay Phone."" The following year he contracted pneumonia and died at the age of 41.  ~ Sandra Brennan- All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Then I took her for my wife in the spring of my life And she brought me a joy I'd never known.  And the years- they went by in the spring of my life And in summer she blessed me with a child. Love continued to grow in the summer of my life And in every morning sun I saw her smile.  But in the autumn of my years I noticed the tears And I knew that our life was in the past. Though I tried to pretend- I knew it was the end For the autumn of my life had come at last.  Now what- what do you say to a child of ten? How do you tell him his daddy's going away? Do I tell him that I've reached the autumn of my life And that he'll understand some winter's day.  Now a rose can't be found on a snow covered ground And the sun cannot shine through cloudy skies. But I'm richer you see for the years she gave to me And I'm content in the autumn of my life.,6,95,2,20050,nullBobby Hebb,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubvYQxTXO3U,ubvYQxTXO3U,Bobby Hebb - Sunny,1966 USA # 2,415,5277,30,1194091,nullBobby Hebb,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMOUu9T7Olg,CMOUu9T7Olg,Bobby Hebb-You've Got Soul LIVE 1971,with Ron Carter on bass    For an index of soul / funk performances across the internet where you can discuss and submit more videos- check out http://www.changingscene.com/Soul%20and%20Funk%20Performances,9,136,0,28042,nullBobby Lewis,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uEPDEJbJu0,3uEPDEJbJu0,Tossin' and Turnin' - Bobby Lewis,This song made it to the number one spot on Billboards Top 100 1961,99,586,14,155457,nullBobby Lewis,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PMqXEcotc0,5PMqXEcotc0,Bobby Lewis ~ How Long Has It Been (1967) [LIVE],Audio taken from the original 1967 Grand Ole Opry transcription disc- restored using MAGIX Audio Cleaning Lab.

It was his father who encouraged him to pursue a career in show business. At the age of four- Rydell would sit in front of the TV and impersonate such performers as Milton Berle- Louis Prima and Johnny Ray. He also admired drummer Gene Krupa and began playing the drums at the age of six. At the age of seven and with his father's encouragement- Rydell began performing in nightclubs in Philadelphia.   In 1950- Bobby Rydell entered the amateur show of Paul Whiteman; his first-place win gained him a regular part on the show. He stayed with the Whiteman show for three years and then went to join several local bands in Philadelphia. It was here too that Bobby Ridarelli became the easier-to-pronounce Bobby Rydell. At 16 he began playing with local groups- landing a spot as a drummer for Rocco and the Saints. (Frankie Avalon- another Philadelphia-born musician- played trumpet for the group.) While with the band- Rydell signed a recording contract with Cameo/Parkway Records in Philadelphia. His hit ""Kissin' Time-"" recorded in the summer of 1959- launched his musical career and made him a teen idol at the age of 17.   After making his first hit recording- he pursued a solo career- performing at the Copacabana in New York in 1961- where he was an instant hit. Rydell made his acting debut in 1962 on the television show Combat! One year later- he starred as Hugh Peabody in the famous musical Bye Bye Birdie. It was only after his acting debut that he fervently began playing the nightclub circuit.   With records like We Got Love- Wildwood Days and Sway- Rydell made himself a hit. Along with Frankie Avalon and Fabian- Bobby Rydell is known as a Philadelphia-born teen idol- known not only for his musical genius but also his handsome looks.   ~ Kim Summers- All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Add to that an equally sincere and strong vocal performance by Bobby Vee and you have one of the greatest hits of all time.     I had the pleasure and honor of meeting Bobby Vee after a show four years ago-  and he took the time to talk to my wife and I- and to sign a rare EP from Barcelona- Spain.

The Saturday night city beat had already started  The pulse of the corner boys sprang into action  And young Billy watched it all under the yellow street light  And said ""tonight of all nights there's gonna be a fight""    Billy dont like it living here in this town  He says the traps have been sprung long before he was born  He says ""hope bites the dust behind all the closed doors""  And pus and grime ooze from its scab crusted sores.  There's screaming and crying in the high rise blocks""  It's a rat trap Billy but you're already caught  But you can make it if you want to or you need it bad enough    You're young and good looking and you're acting kind of tough  Anyway it's Saturday night time to see what's going down.  Put on the bright suit Billy- head for the right side of town  It's only 8 o'clock but you're already bored  You don't know what it is but there's got to be more  You'd better find a way out- hey kick down the door  It's a rat trap and you've been caught    In this town Billy says ""everybody tries to tell you what to do""  In this town Billy says ""everybody says you gotta follow rules.""  You walk up to those traffic lights-  Switch from your left to right  You push in that button- and when that button comes alight   It tells you   ""Walk don't walk- Talk don't talk""......  Billy take a walk ...  Hey Billy take a walk with me.    Little Judy's trying to watch ""top of the pops""  But mum and dad are fighting don't they ever stop-  She take down her coat and walks out on the street-  It's cold on that road- but it's got that home beat-  Deep down in her pockets she finds 50p.-  Now is that any way for a young girl to be-  ""I'm gonna get out of school work in some factory-  Work all the hours God gave me get myself a little easy money""  Now- now- now na na.    Her mind's made up- she walks down the road-  Her hands in her pockets- coat buttoned 'gainst the cold-  She finds Billy down at the Italion cafe  And when he's drunk it's hard to understand what Billy says  But then he mumbles in his coffee and suddenly roars-  ""It's a rat trap Judy; and we've been caught....""",304,868,23,319260,nullBoomtown Rats,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjcmG608pJM,TjcmG608pJM,The Boomtown Rats - I Don't Like Mondays - (Live @ Isle Of White Festival 2013) HQ,,12,51,0,12885,nullBoston,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjXZrDG4_gg,wjXZrDG4_gg,Boston  --   More   Than  A  Feeling  [[  Official  Live   Video  ]]  HD,Boston  --   More   Than  A  Feeling  :: Lyrics  ::  I looked out this morning and the sun was gone  Turned on some music to start my day  I lost myself in a familiar song  I closed my eyes and I slipped away   It's more than a feeling  (More than a feeling)  When I hear that old song they used to play  (More than a feeling)  I begin dreaming  (More than a feeling)  'Til I see Marianne walk away  I see my Marianne walkin' away   So many people have come and gone  Their faces fade as the years go by  Yet I still recall as I wander on  As clear as the sun in the summer sky   It's more than a feeling  (More than a feeling)  When I hear that old song they used to play  (More than a feeling)  I begin dreaming  (More than a feeling)  'Til I see Marianne walk away  I see my Marianne walkin' away   When I'm tired and thinking cold  I hide in my music- forget the day  And dream of a girl I used to know  I closed my eyes and she slipped away  She slipped away   It's more than a feeling  More than a feeling When I hear that old song they used to play  More than a feeling I begin dreaming   ::More than a feeling ::  ............LAKEPARADISEMUSIC2..OFFICIAL  MUSIC  CHANNEL...HD,71,339,31,136876,nullBoston,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ze4JtKPq-c,0Ze4JtKPq-c,BOSTON - More Than A Feeling (LIVE 1979),Video - Jun 17 1979 Giants Stadium East Rutherford,316,1322,37,391855,nullBow Wow,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVB-ccLg_E,HUVB-ccLg_E,Bow Wow - Nah (Official Video),Bow Wow - Nah (Official Video) (2014),46,722,29,129700,nullBow Wow,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs3nqFxTKmU,Vs3nqFxTKmU,Bow Wow - Like You (Live In Miami 2005)-feat Ciara (VIDEO),From DVD Scream Tour IV Heartthrobs Live  http://www.amazon.com/Scream-Tour-IV-Heartthrobs-Live/dp/B000C4BBZC,6,138,1,24909,nullBox Tops,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toBl4rvTgs8,toBl4rvTgs8,Box Tops - The Letter (1967),,831,4886,82,1411406,nullBox Tops,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxg2zXPJFjc,nxg2zXPJFjc,The Box Tops - The Letter (live),The Box Tops - The Letter (live)- 14/07/2001- WTC Plaza NYC.    35 years on- Alex Chilton and the Memphis crew haven't lost a lick.,121,359,7,186302,nullBoys Like Girls,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGPgxoIPY6Q,JGPgxoIPY6Q,Boys Like Girls - The Great Escape,Music video by Boys Like Girls performing The Great Escape.

The song was recorded by Queen around 1988 or before- and was intended to be on the band's The Miracle album in 1989- but did not make the cut. After Freddie Mercury's death in 1991- May arranged a solo version- which he performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992-[2] and subsequently included on his solo album Back to the Light that same year. Released as a single- it reached #5 on the UK Singles Chart. Because it was first played publicly at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert- a common misconception is that it was written as a tribute to Freddie Mercury- although it had actually been written several years prior.

(Sorry- video advertising is a matter of youtube- I have nothing to do.)  Buffalo Springfield was a rock group that served as a springboard for the careers of Neil Young- Stephen Stills- Richie Furay and Jim Messina- two of whom played in rock- pop- folk- country and acoustic group Crosby- Stills- Nash and Young later in their career. Buffalo Springfield is best known for the song ""For What It's Worth"". After the band's formation in April 1966- a series of disruptions- including infighting and the pressure of working in the music industry- resulted in constant changes in the group's lineup and ultimately culminated in the group's disbanding after roughly 25 months. Buffalo Springfield released a total of three albums but left many demo recordings- studio outtakes and live recordings- as well as a reputation for excellent personnel and high band dysfunction.[1] Despite the band's short tenure and relatively limited output it was one of the most influential bands of the 1960s- with virtually all members going on to successful careers and with two (Stills and Young) reaching the top of rock stardom.  Components of the band. Richie Furay Dewey Martin Jim Messina Stephen Stills Neil Young Bruce Palmer  iFlubes: This song dedicates to his big friend Daniel and to his dad already died the two- they died being in love of this song- which they rest in peace. iFlubes  For What It's Worth : There's somethin' happenin' here. What it is ain't exactly clear. There's a man with a gun over there A-tellin' me I've got to beware.  I think it's time we stop. Children- what's that sound? Everybody look what's goin' down.  There's battle lines bein' drawn. Nobody's right if everybody's wrong. Young people speakin' their minds A-gettin' so much resistance from behind.  I think it's time we stop. Hey- what's that sound? Everybody look what's goin' down.  What a field day for the heat. A thousand people in the street Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs Mostly sayin' hooray for our side.  It's time we stop. Hey- what's that sound? Everybody look what's goin' down.  Paranoia strikes deep. Into your life it will creep. It starts when you're always afraid. Step out of line- the men come and take you away.

In 2010- Green took a hiatus from working with Danger Mouse- and released a solo single titled ""Fuck You!""- on August 19. The song became a successful single- with the radio-edit version ""Forget You""- reaching the top spot in the UK and the Netherlands and peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Its parent album- The Lady Killer (2010)- saw similar success- peaking within the top five of the UK Albums Chart and debuting within the top 10 on the Billboard 200 albums chart- receiving a Gold certification from the BPI in the UK. His next two singles- ""It's OK"" and ""Bright Lights Bigger City"" were also hits in Europe. From 2011 to 2014- Green was a judge and coach on American reality television singing competition The Voice- appearing on four of its seasons. In 2013- Green reunited with the rest of Goodie Mob- to release their fifth studio album Age Against the Machine.  He has ventured into work as a voice actor in the animated feature Hotel Transylvania (2012) and also made appearances in a few television programs and films- including his own show The Good Life on TBS.

Charlie Spivak was often billed as ""The Sweetest Trumpet In The World"" . In my opinion- Spivak- Harry James- & Billy Butterfield & a few others- were probably some of the best ""sweet"" trumpet players to come out of the ""Big Band Era"" .  He started out in the early 1920's and by the time he formed his orchestra in 1939- he had already played with such orchestra's fronted by - Paul Specht- Ben Pollack- The Dorsey Brother's- Bob Crosby-   Tommy Dorsey- & Jack Teagarden.   The Stardusters - consisting of Glen Gaylon- Curt Purnell- & Dick Wylder started out as a trio while still in high school and upon graduation - they decided to follow their dreams of a vocal career- instead of attending Yale.  By 1939 and after several guest appearances- they landed their very own radio program on NBC.  June Hutton - Ina Ray Hutton's younger sister and once member of The Quintones vocal group-   joined the original Stardusters in approx. 1940 and the group was complete.  They recorded WHEN I SEE AN ELEPHANT FLY- AT LAST- I SURRENDER DEAR- A WEEKEND IN HAVANA- THIS IS NO LAUGHING MATTER- BROTHER BILL- &  I REMEMBER YOU and a few others with Charlie Spivak's Orchestra. They later recorded with several popular vocalists of the day- including  Evelyn Knight- with whom they recorded the 1949 hit - A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME.",12,66,0,17993,nullCharlie Spivak,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhFK4Rnw4NU,dhFK4Rnw4NU,Wonderful Winter ~ Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra  (live -1945),Wonderful Winter ~ Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra  ~ Jimmy Saunders ~ (live - 1945) Taken from the Victory Parade Of Spotlight Bands radio program on January 19- 1945.

His debut album earned him five Grammys. He is perhaps best known for his Top Ten hit songs- ""Sailing""- ""Ride Like the Wind""- and ""Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)""- the last of which he performed for the film Arthur starring Dudley Moore.""Sailing"" earned three Grammy Awards in 1981- while ""Arthur's Theme"" won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 1981 (with co-composers Burt Bacharach- Carole Bayer Sager and Peter Allen).  Christopher Cross filled in for guitarist Richie Blackmore of Deep Purple (who had fallen ill) by performing with the band in San Antonio- Texas in 1970  also contributed backing vocals (along with The Beach Boys' Carl Wilson) to David Lee Roth's 1985 hit ""California Girls""  Christopher Cross performed the song ""Sailing"" alongside the pop band 'N Sync at the Fifth Annual Blockbuster Entertainment Awards in 1999.  He also performed lead vocals on ""So Far Away""- a song from Alan Parsons' album On Air. When Parsons was touring in support of that album- Cross would sometimes join the band onstage to sing the song if he was available.  A small snippet of Cross's early hit ""Sailing"" was played in the DreamWorks film ""Flushed Away""  ""Sailing"" is a number-one single- released in July 1980- The song was a phenomenal success- winning Grammy Awards for Record of the Year- Song of the Year- and Arrangement of the Year- and helping Cross win the Best New Artist award. VH1 named this the greatest ""softsational soft rock"" music song of all time.  It was a number-one rated single in the United States. Since its debut- it has been covered by many artists- including Avant- Barry Manilow- Big Bub- 'N Sync- Phajja- and Patrick Yandall.  The Mexican airline AeroM_xico used the theme during the middle 1980s as a jingle for its advertisements; it was also used for the cigarette brand Winston.  Lyrics:  Well- it's not far down to paradise-At least it's not for me  And if the wind is right-You can sail away and find tranquility  Oh- the canvas can do miracles-Just you wait and see-Believe me  It's not far to never-never land- No reason to pretend  And if the wind is right-You can find the joy of innocence again  Oh- the canvas can do miracles- Just you wait and see-Believe me  Sailing takes me away-To where I've always heard it could be  Just a dream and the wind to carry me-And soon I will be free  Fantasy- it gets the best of me-When I'm sailing  All caught up in the reverie-Every word is a symphony  Won't you believe me-Sailing takes me away  To where I've always heard it could be-Just a dream and the wind to carry me  And soon I will be free-Well it's not far back to sanity  At least it's not for me-And if the wind is right  you can sail away and find serenity-Oh- the canvas can do miracles  Just you wait and see-Believe me- Sailing takes me away  To where I've always heard it could be- Just a dream and the wind to carry me  And soon I will be free",1187,8218,246,1594400,nullChristopher Cross,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMZ95lT90jI,OMZ95lT90jI,Christopher Cross - Arthurs Theme (Live),,13,110,2,24612,nullChubby Checker,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbK0C9AYMd8,xbK0C9AYMd8,Chubby Checker - The Twist,Chubby Checker - The Twist,1161,6230,136,2676001,nullChubby Checker,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbSYDZbFpOM,hbSYDZbFpOM,Chubby Checker - The Twist (Live 1961),Follow the past 50 years of Rock n' Roll as if it is happening today at www.pigcityrecords.com  Here it is -- the be and end all- the bees knees- the balls- the business- the Scorsese/Eastwood/John Cash of twisting.

It really is a great track with great energy and feel- and it was largely responsible for the beginning of a craze that took over popular music for a few months too long in my opinion.

An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music- Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager- as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings- however- were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit- ""Move It"" (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock & roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain- scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these- although it was by no means one of the more successful- was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad ""Blue Turns to Grey"").   In his homeland- Richard's popularity was diminished only slightly by the rise of the Beatles- but in his prime- he had a much rougher time in the U.S.- hitting the Top 40 only three times (with ""Living Doll"" in 1959- ""It's All in the Game"" in 1963- and ""Devil Woman"" in 1976). Richard belatedly cracked the U.S. Top Ten in 1976 with ""Devil Woman-"" and racked up a few other hits (""We Don't Talk Anymore-"" ""Dreaming-"" ""A Little in Love"") in a mainstream pop/rock style. He remains an institution in Britain- where he is one of the nation's most popular all-around entertainers of all time. ~ Richie Unterberger- All Music Guide  _____________________________________  In 2008- Richard's 50th year in music- will see the release of the 8CD box set- And They Said It Wouldn't Last (My 50 Years In Music).  In September- a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music- titled * Thank you for a Lifetime has been released. On the 14th of September 2008 Thank You For A Lifetime reached No.3 on the UK music charts- which gives Cliff a Top 3 hit in each of his six decades as a singer.  On 2nd November 2008- British newspaper The Mail on Sunday gave away a free promotional CD entitled '50th Anniversary' containing 12 tracks picked by Sir Cliff himself.",3024,15586,423,5536648,nullCliff Richard,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1obRHLmQ3gw,1obRHLmQ3gw,Cliff Richard - Ocean Deep (Live),Love cant you see Im alone  Cant you give this fool a chance  A little love is all I ask - a little kindness  In the night  Please dont leave me behind  No - dont tell me love is blind  A little love is all I ask and that is all    Oh love Ive been searching so long  Ive been searching highnlow  A little love is all I ask - a little sadness  When youre gone  Maybe you need a friend  Only please dont lets pretend  A little love is all I ask and that is all    I wanna spread my wings - but I just cant fly  As a string of pearls and pretty girls go sailing by    Ocean deep - Im so afraid to show my feelings  I have sailed a million ceilings - in my -  Solitary room  Ocean deep - will I ever find a lover  Maybe she has found another  And as I cry myself to sleep  I know this love of mine Ill keep - ocean deep    Love cant you hear when I call  Cant you hear a word I say  A little love is all I ask  A little feeling when we touch  Why am I still alone?

Founding members Kevin Scott MacMichael (guitar) and Nick Van Eede (vocals) met in Halifax- Nova Scotia- while both musicians were on tour with their respective bands. A musical connection was made- and MacMichael soon left his native Australia and relocated to England- where he and Van Eede immediately began to collaborate. After signing with Siren Records on the strength of their demos- Cutting Crew became a foursome in 1986 with the addition of bassist Colin Farley and drummer Martin Beadle; they entered the recording studio that same year. While the pace was certainly quick- the quartet was comprised of veterans; Eede had toured the world with his Sussex-based outfit the Drivers- MacMichael served time as guitarist for Fast Forward- Beadle was a one-time member of Hull- and Farley had completed hours of session work for many artists.   Cutting Crew released their debut album- Broadcast- in 1986. The group received mixed reviews from music critics- but not when it came to the album's undeniable highlight- the synth-heavy ""(I Just) Died in Your Arms."" The song became smash hit in the United States- reaching number one on the Billboard singles chart and enjoying similar success in the U.K. ""One for the Mockingbird"" and ""I've Been in Love Before"" also enjoyed significant radio play- and the band left home for a worldwide tour- standing in as opening act for such groups as the Bangles- Starship- and Huey Lewis & the News.  Cutting Crew released a sophomore album- The Scattering- in 1989. A third full-length effort- 1992's Compus Mentus- failed to revive their sagging popularity- however- and Cutting Crew called it quits the following year. MacMichael paired up with Robert Plant for the singer's 1993 solo effort- Fate of Nations- while Nick Van Eede chose to revive Cutting Crew the following decade. Featuring a radically different lineup- the group released Grinning Souls in 2006.",1128,12412,159,2104825,nullCutting Crew,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJlz_FtnLG0,IJlz_FtnLG0,Cutting Crew - Been In Love Before (live),Town & Country gig 1989 part 5 of 10,41,236,6,64748,nullCyndi Lauper,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdQY7BusJNU,VdQY7BusJNU,Cyndi Lauper - Time After Time,Music video by Cyndi Lauper performing Time After Time.

Dan was an amazing talent- and his body of work deserves to be recognized. Dan Fogelberg ~ Same Old Lang Syne A 1975 Christmas Eve encounter with his ex-girlfriend in a local convenience-store- 5 years later- Dan released the beautiful song ""Same Old Lang Syne"". Since the song's release in 1980- Peoria as well as the rest of Dan fans worldwide has wondered about the ""old lover"" referenced in the song...  To find out the story behind ""Same Old Lang Syne"" please read the article title ""It's a memory that I cherish""originally published in 2007 by Peoria (Illinois) Journal-Star columnist Phil Luciano.

Robert E. Lee. Born and raised in Bossier City- Louisiana- Houston became a regular on the Louisiana Hayride as a teenager. Apparently his soaring tenor voice wasn't totally appreciated; he found trouble getting work in the music business- and ended up as an insurance underwriter. But record producer Billy Sherrill brought Houston into the fold when Epic Records was still a young label (the early '60s)- and Houston brought the company its first real hit with ""Mountain of Love."" In 1966 he broke through to major status with ""Almost Persuaded-"" which netted a pair of Grammy awards and brought pop recognition as well. A member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1971- he racked up 28 hit records over a decade- including duets with Tammy Wynette and Barbara Mandrell.  ~ Tom Roland- All Music Guide   PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

The song spent 23 weeks on the ""Top 40"" charts.   It was number one for five weeks on the Billboard pop charts. The song was nominated for a ""Best Song"" Academy Award in 1957- but lost to ""All The Way"" from the film- ""The Joker Is Wild.""      In the movie (the first of the Tammy film series- and the only one Debbie Reynolds starred in)- she co-starred with Leslie Nielsen.      At the time ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" was filmed- Debbie Reynolds was still married to Eddie Fisher.  Less than a year later- Eddie Fisher began his affair with Elizabeth Taylor.  Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher were divorced in 1959.    In the film- as she sings the song- she's interrupted by her Aunt Renie (played by Mildred Natwick.)  For this video- I deleted that part- and spliced in scenes between Debbie Reynolds and Leslie Nielsen- and overlayed the soundtrack with a clean audio.

Corinthian ""Krips"" Johnson- Norman Wright and Clarence Quick were black- and David Lerchey and Donald ""Gus"" Backus were white.  Although the group's two biggest hits- ""Whispering Bells"" and ""Come Go With Me"" were released by Dot Records in 1957 and 1958- both songs were actually recorded in 1956 for a small Pittsburgh label called FeeBee Records. The songs became a hit in the local Pittsburgh area and Dot signed the group to a contract. Instead of having them re-record their songs- which was what was usually done in those situations- Dot simply purchased the master tapes from FeeBee and pressed the records from them--a practice that became commonplace later- but Dot was one of the first- if not the first- to do it.  ~ http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1812573/bio  One of the leading cover groups of the mid-'50s- the Diamonds adapted current R&B hits into pop gold of their own. Hailing from Toronto- the Canadian quartet (consisting of Ted Kowalski- Phil Leavitt- Bill Reed- and Dave Somerville) signed with Mercury in 1955 and immediately zoomed up pop play lists with covers of the Teenagers' ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love""; the Willows' ""Church Bells May Ring""; and their biggest hit of all- a sanitized version of the Gladiolas hit ""Little Darlin'."" Fronted by David Somerville- the quartet hit with an original- the smooth dance outing ""The Stroll."" After weathering major personnel changes- the Diamonds notched their last hit in 1961. Somerville remained active as a solo artist for a time- and the Diamonds often toured the oldies scene.  ~ Bill Dahl- All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

He studied clarinet and drums as a child- and while in high school he formed his own vocal group- concurrently performing in area talent shows as a solo act- and composing his own original material. While performing one of those songs at a high school concert- Jackson was discovered by producer Ollie McLaughlin- who'd previously launched the career of soul diva Barbara Lewis; McLaughlin soon produced Jackson's debut single- 1962's self-penned ""You Said You Love Me."" The record was a Detroit-area hit- as was its follow-up- ""Come Back Home-"" but neither earned any national recognition. Jackson spent the next two years relentlessly touring the Southeast Michigan school dance and nightclub circuit- resurfacing on record in 1965 with the smooth soul classic ""Love Makes the World Go Round"" -- issued on McLaughlin's nascent Carla label; the single was popularized locally by CKLW personality Robin Seymour and became a nationwide smash- falling just shy of the pop Top Ten. An LP of the same name was issued on Atco in 1966- and that spring Jackson returned with the minor hit- 1966's ""Love Takes a Long Time Growing."" Two more Carla singles- ""I Can't Do Without You"" and ""Hard-to-Get Thing Called Love-"" closed out the year- and in late 1967 Jackson resurfaced with the gorgeous floater ""Ooh Baby-"" a longtime favorite among Northern Soul aficionados. After two final Carla efforts -- the 1968 singles ""I Can't Go On"" and ""You Gotta Love-"" -- Jackson landed at Shout for the following year's ""I'll Always Love You."" Rumors of post-1960s sessions remain unconfirmed- and in the years to follow- Jackson largely made his living touring the Chicago cocktail lounge circuit- never fulfilling the enormous creative and commercial promise of his mid-1960s material- although his peak output remains much-adored by aficionados of classic soul. ~Jason Ankeny- All Music  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

The duo lost track of each other until Dee Dee's first year at college when they both started working at See's Candies in Los Angeles. On their lunch breaks they discovered a mutual love of song writing and ended up collaborating on a song called- ""I Want Someone.""  The flip side- The Mountain's High- became their first gold record- storming up the charts in summer of 1961. The song spent two weeks at the #2 position on the Billboard Hot 100. The Mountain's High reached the #37 position in the UK Singles Chart. Dick and Dee Dee played in the Los Angeles area for six months- backed by the new- upcoming surf band- The Beach Boys.  Throughout the Sixties- Dick and Dee Dee recorded a total of eight chart singles- five of which made the top 30 nationally...  Throughout the Sixties- Dick and Dee Dee recorded a total of eight chart singles- five on which made the top 30 nationally- and five albums. Touring with most of the popular recording artists of the era- they traveled throughout the United States- Europe and Japan- singing their biggest hits- The Mountain's High- Tell Me- Turn Around- Young and In Love and Thou Shalt Not Steal.  Dick and Dee Dee performed as semi-regulars on the hit television show- ""Shindig"" and in the original pilot for the television show- ""Where the Action Is."" The duo appeared numerous times on American Bandstand and in the movie- ""Wild- Wild Winter."" They made one Scopitone (similar to today's music videos)- shot at Santa Monica pier.  In a London recording session in 1964- produced by Rolling Stones producer Andrew Oldham- the duo added their voices to several tracks with instruments and back up vocals by the Rolling Stones. The songs ""Blue Turns to Grey"" and ""Something's Just Stick in You Mind-"" penned by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were Picks of the Week on Shindig- but never climbed the charts nationally.  dick and dee deeThe duo disbanded in 1969. In the Eighties- Dick performed briefly as Dick and Dee Dee with his wife Sandy. He passed away in 2003.  In 2007 Dee Dee Phelps released her memoir- Vinyl Highway- Singing as Dick and Dee Dee. Fans at book signings and talks told her how much the songs of Dick and Dee Dee meant to them and what they wouldn't give to hear those songs sung live again.  With those comments in mind- in 2009 Dee Dee re-created the act Dick and Dee Dee- with her new partner- singing/actor Michael Dunn. They are currently appearing in Doo Wop and Rock and Roll Shows throughout the country.

They were backed by Silkworm- who later embarked on a solo career under the name King Britt.    Digable Planets' fusion of jazz and hip hop received excellent reviews and solid sales with the release of its debut album- Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space)- in 1993- which was certified gold by the RIAA. The album's lead single- ""Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)-"" in 1994 became a crossover hit- peaking at #15 on Billboard magazine's singles chart- earning gold certification by the RIAA- and winning the Grammy award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.    Its second album- Blowout Comb- was released in 1994 (see 1994 in music). The novelty of the group's jazz/hip-hop fusion had passed- leading to disappointing sales. The trio soon broke up due to creative differences- as well as the deaths of both of Ladybug's parents due to unrelated illnesses. However- a retrospective album Beyond the Spectrum: The Creamy Spy Chronicles was released in 2005- which included unreleased recordings.    The Planets played at BB King's in Times Square- NYC on 10/8/2008 and announced that a new album would be released in 2008.

The song sampled Funkadelic's 1979 hit- ""(Not Just) Knee Deep"" for which the song's writers- George Clinton and Philipp_ Wynne- received writing credits. Released a year after the groups breakthrough single- ""The Humpty Dance""- ""Kiss You Back"" became Digital Underground's second top-40 single- peaking at No. 40 on the Billboard Hot 100- and earned a gold certification on April 9- 1992 for sales of 500-000 copies. Sons of the P is the third album by American rap group Digital Underground- released on October 15- 1991. The album featured two hit singles- ""No Nose Job"" and ""Kiss You Back""- both of which were written by- and featured the lead vocals of Greg Jacobs (a.k.a. Shock G/Humpty Hump)- and the latter of which featured multi-layered choruses and background vocals sung by Boni Boyer- who briefly worked with D.U. shortly after her stint with Prince's Sign of the Times/Love Sexy band. It is sometimes mistakenly reported that Kiss You Back was co-written & co-performed by George Clinton- but his name appropriately appears in the writers credit due to a sample of ""(Not Just) Knee Deep"" by Funkadelic. He did however actively participate in the writing and recording of the title track ""Sons of the P""- to which he also contributed vocals- and which marked one of the earliest studio guest appearances by Clinton on a Hip Hop release- preceded only by Kurtis Blow's ""Magilla Gorilla"" released in 1986. Both the album and the single ""Kiss You Back"" were each certified Gold by the RIAA. Digital Underground was an alternative hip hop group from Oakland- California. Their personnel changed and rotated with each album and tour. Digital Underground's leader was Greg ""Shock G"" Jacobs (also known as Humpty Hump); Shock G formed the group in 1987 with Jimi ""Chopmaster J"" Dright of Berkeley- California- and Tampa hip-hop radio deejay Kenneth ""Kenny-K"" Waters. Heavily influenced by the various funk bands of the 1970s- Digital Underground sampled such music frequently- which became a defining element of West Coast rap. As ""Rackadelic""- Jacobs designed album covers and cartoon-laced liner notes- in homage to Parliament-Funkadelic album designs. Digital Underground is also notable for launching the career of member Tupac Shakur- as well as spinning off side projects and solo acts including Raw Fusion- Saafir- and female singer Mystic. Following the release of their ""Doowutchyalike"" single and video in the summer of 1989- and the band's gained popularity by their song ""The Humpty Dance"" in 1990- Digital Underground toured nearly every year up until 2008; this consisted of thousands[quantify] of live shows in Europe- Japan- Canada- Australia- and the U.S. While the group's origins lay mostly in Oakland and Berkeley- California- various characters and voices from around the U.S. appeared on the band's albums- while Shock G and Money-B were the only individuals to appear on every album. Other recurring key contributors were David ""DJ Fuze"" Elliot- and deejay/producer Jeremy ""J-Beats"" Jackson- who both assisted Jacobs in developing the sound. The group appeared in and donated music to the 1991 Dan Aykroyd film Nothing but Trouble. After approximately twenty years of touring- Shock G announced that the group would officially disband in 2008. Shortly after that announcement was made- the group also confirmed that their May 2008 album ..Cuz A d.u.

Remixes for 'Setting Sun' (Part 1) include the hand of the beautiful Nora En Pure - who delivers a stunning Deep House Remix sounding like a refreshing break from the the oh-so-popular bangers- and up and coming UK producer DJ Chad Tyson - who delivers a dancefloor-ready interpretation of the Track- pitching down the vocal on top of a sunny Nu Disco groove.  Remixes for 'Setting Sun' (Part 2) include David Guetta's favorites Daddy's Groove & fellow producers Heymen - who supply a big and bold anthem that showcases their soulful capabilities for blending acoustic and electronic elements to spectacular effect. This is set to be one of the tunes of the Summer. The Remix by super hot Scottish legend Grum is another big party Dance anthem with a great euphoric build up- electric arpeggiated vibes and hints of Pryda. As perfect for radio as it is for the dancefloor- this is crafted to fill the largest and loudest arenas at this festivals season. Chromeo's Last Gang very own- New Yorkers Leisure Cruise deliver an awesome and playful retro electro funk sounding like an update extended mix of this stunning Track- littered with lush 80's synth-Pop / Nu Disco moments.  Steve Smith & Paul Harris are well versed in the world of Electronic music creating Dirty Vegas over 10 years ago and are ready for the next step in the bands evolution. Continuing a legacy of excellence in a career that has garnered innumerable accolades including the pretentious Grammy for Best Electronic Album. Smith & Harris have spent 2013 working on new material- not to chase the trend of EDM but because Electronic music is in their blood- in their being and soul. The result is their 6th official release; an EP titled 'Let The Night' released on d:vision this Spring and already charting Top 3 on iTunes US Dance Albums.,34,884,20,168757,nullDirty Vegas,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIhIJVNNi2g,EIhIJVNNi2g,Dirty Vegas - Days Gone By (Live) Tucson- AZ - PLUSH,A well received performance at Plush on 4th Avenue in Tucson Arizona.

The band's name comes from an Indian term for a person providing cable television to a neighborhood.    The Santa Barbara- CA- band Dishwalla made a big splash in 1996 with their catchy pop single ""Counting Blue Cars."" With the gritty heart and soul of those who came before them- Dishwalla's hard rock sound was enough for fans to make ""Counting Blue Cars"" one of the most-requested songs of that year. The song also garnered the band a Billboard award for Rock Song of the Year and allowed their debut album- Pet Your Friends- to sell more than a million copies.    Dishwalla- which emerged out of the early stages of post-grunge- is composed of J.R. Richards (vocals)- Scot Alexander (bass)- Rodney Browning (guitar)- Jim Wood (keyboards)- and George Pendergast (drums). They spent the mid-'90s touring with the likes of Sheryl Crow- Blind Melon- and the Goo Goo Dolls in support of Pet Your Friends. Prior to making a second album- the band was caught in the middle of the Polygram/Universal merger and such a move left Dishwalla pondering what to do next. Their second album And You Think You Know What Life's About was released in 1998; promotion and sales were lackluster due to label downsizing. Dishwalla's time with A&M was shortlived and exhausting because of such corporate behavior- but they stuck it out to contribute their cover version of ""Policy of Truth"" for the Depeche Mode tribute album For the Masses. By the new millennium- Dishwalla left behind major-market America for a third album. They signed with Immergent while Pendergrast left the band. Pete Maloney- a drummer picked up on the 1998 tour- resumed percussion duties. In 2002- Dishwalla appeared sound and sane- issuing the experimental third album Opaline. A self-titled album followed in 2005.  Back to the topMembers of Dishwalla      In 1996- the single ""Counting Blue Cars"" from the album Pet Your Friends climbed the charts and was much-played on the airwaves- bringing the band a short round of mainstream-scale success. The track earned them a Billboard Award for ""Best Rock Song"" for 1996 as well as two ASCAP Awards for ""Rock Track Of The Year"" in both 1996 and 1997. Their 1998 follow-up album- And You Think You Know What Life's About- failed to sustain the level of popularity achieved by ""Counting Blue Cars"". (Partially responsible for the situation was Universal's 1998 purchase and dissolution of A&M/Polygram- the label that produced the two albums.) The group is remembered for their creative compositions and the smooth yet powerful vocals of J.R. Richards. Their unique style and musical talent landed them many movie and TV series ventures.    Dishwalla have since made a handful of other ventures into the limelight. In 1995 the song ""Counting Blue Cars"" was featured in the movie ""Empire Records"". In 1998 landed the song ""Truth Serum"" in The Avengers; in 1999- the song ""Stay Awake"" was featured in the movie Stir of Echoes' and the song ""Find Your Way Back Home"" was featured in the movie American Pie in 2002 the song ""Home"" was in the movie The Banger Sisters; and the The WB series Charmed spotlighted Dishwalla as musical guests in one episode. Other TV shows that have used their songs include Smallville- The OC- Cold Case and NCIS. The band- which has a loyal fan following- has gone on to release two more studio albums- Opaline and the self-titled Dishwalla- as well as a live album- Live... Greetings From The Flow State.    Five singles charted on Billboard. In 1996- ""Counting Blue Cars"" peaked at #15 on the Hot 100 but climbed to #5 on both the Adult Top 40 and Hot 100 Airplay charts- #4 on the Top 40 Mainstream charts- #2 on the Mainstream Rock charts- and #1 on the Modern Rock charts. ""Charlie Brown's Parents"" hit #24 on the Mainstream Rock charts. The following year- ""Give"" was a #26 Adult Top 40 single. In 1998- ""Once in a While"" reached #17 on the Mainstream Rock charts and #20 on the Modern Rock charts. Finally- ""Somewhere in the Middle"" hit #25 on the Adult Top 40 charts in 2002.    In 2006 the band decided to take a break from recording.    In 2008 Dishwalla returned to touring with a modified lineup. The band's original drummer George Pendergast and the lead singer of Tripdavon- Justin Fox- as ""Special Guest Vocalist"" will be playing shows.    Lead Singer J.R. Richards has recorded a debut solo album titled ""A Beautiful End"" scheduled to be released in early 2009.",126,540,7,183357,nullDivinyls,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5boYiMktOvs,5boYiMktOvs,DIVINYLS - Pleasure & Pain (1985) HD,DIVINYLS - Pleasure & Pain HD,83,88,0,16789,nullDivinyls,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r71xajhDFUo,r71xajhDFUo,"Divinyls ""I TOUCH MYSELF"" LIVE in CONCERT NYC 1991","Divinyls perform their international hit single- ""I touch myself"" in concert in New York City 1991.

Originally released on John Henry Kurtz' 1972 REUNION album- the indelible classic always takes me away...to that far away place I used to reside -- within the deepest caverns of my soul. At times the song makes me weep- as I miss the halcyon days of my youth and the kinder world we thrived in. When any ills of the world would be swept away when reaching for your LP of your favorite music was all that was needed to- well- drift away.    The song was covered hundreds of times these past 40 years- most famously and recently in a passionless 2003 recording by Uncle Kracker. Credited as Uncle Kracker featuring Dobie Gray- the track meandered along in  karaoke sterility until finally Gray's soul chimed in mid-point and he infused it with a thrilling tremble. When the track reached #9 on Billboard's Top 100- Gray broke the record for the biggest gap between top US top 10 appearances (it had been 30 years between both). The Kracker version had a far more major impact on Billboard's Adult Contemporary charts -- it holds the record as the longest #1 on that chart- having reigned for 28 weeks in 2003-04. No doubt thanks to Gray.    There was a story told by Kracker that the song was initially written for Elvis- but Presley turned it down once he heard Gray's version of it.  Gray was a demo singer in Memphis at the time.  Talk about decree.    ***************************  Dobie Gray (background vocals); Dobie Gray (vocals); Larry Byrum- Larry Byrom (guitar); Nashville Strings Players- Damon Seal (strings); Terri McMillian- Terry McMillan (harmonica- percussion); David Dunston (horns- programming); Jay Patton- Mark Douthit (horns); Gary Smith- Matt Rollings- Matt Rollins (keyboards); Dave Pomeroy - Mike Leech (bass guitar); John Hammond (drums); Bill Hinds (guitar); Ron Oates (strings- keyboards); Eddie Bayers (drums); The Nashville Strings. { - backup vocals}",1559,8665,84,1161340,nullDobie Gray,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaPnOASOWIU,zaPnOASOWIU,Dobie Gray.

Welcome to the hotel california Such a lovely place Such a lovely face Plenty of room at the hotel california Any time of year- you can find it here  Her mind is tiffany-twisted- she got the mercedes bends She got a lot of pretty- pretty boys- that she calls friends How they dance in the courtyard- sweet summer sweat. Some dance to remember- some dance to forget  So I called up the captain- 'please bring me my wine' He said- 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine' And still those voices are calling from far away- Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say...  Welcome to the hotel california Such a lovely place Such a lovely face They livin' it up at the hotel california What a nice surprise- bring your alibis  Mirrors on the ceiling- The pink champagne on ice And she said 'we are all just prisoners here- of our own device' And in the master's chambers- They gathered for the feast The stab it with their steely knives- But they just can't kill the beast  Last thing I remember- I was Running for the door I had to find the passage back To the place I was before 'relax-' said the night man- We are programmed to receive.

Hits including ""If You Ain't Lovin' (You Ain't Livin')"" and ""Live Fast- Love Hard- Die Young"" marked him as a honky tonk singer in sound and personal style; and his chart-topping singles ""Hello Walls"" and ""It's Four in the Morning"" showed his versatility as a vocalist. Known as the Hillbilly Heartthrob- and following a movie role- the Young Sheriff- Young's singles reliably charted for more than 30 years. He committed suicide in 1996. Young is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. Young apparently felt the industry had turned its back on him.That- and despondency over his deteriorating health- were cited as possible reasons why Young shot himself with a 38-caliber pistol on December 9- 1996. He died in Nashville the following day and was cremated. His ashes were spread by his family into Old Hickory Lake outside Nashville- with Johnny and June Carter Cash in attendance.",8,91,1,15672,nullFastball,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0wfu3tOrtQ,b0wfu3tOrtQ,Fastball - The Way,original video  official homepage http://www.fastballtheband.com/,7056,33685,733,9304013,nullFastball,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea37CSb9eRk,ea37CSb9eRk,Fastball: Out of My Head (live),Fastball live at The Continental Club in Houston- Texas on October 27- 2007.

The Flying Pickets are a British a cappella vocal group- who had a Christmas number one hit in 1983 in the UK Singles Chart with their cover of Yazoo's track ""Only You"".    The name 'Flying Pickets' refers to mobile strikers who travel in order to join a picket. The band of six was founded by Brian Hibbard in 1982 from a group of actors who had been active with him in John McGrath's '7:84 Theatre Group'- a fringe theatre organisation who had sung a cappella in their production of the 1981 play One Big Blow. The group chose the name The Flying Pickets as band members had played a part in the UK miners strikes of 1972 and 1974.[2] The Flying Pickets came up with the then novel concept of transferring the art of a cappella to the pop music scene.[3] Joining Hibbard in the Group were Rick Lloyd (who also wrote the music to One Big Blow)- Gareth Williams- David Brett- Ken Gregson (Real name Kenneth Gregory) and Red Stripe (real name David Gittins). The members of the group were internationally renowned for their flamboyant appearance: Hibbard's huge sideburns- Stripe's thick eye-liner- and four others showing off gaudy suits and large hats. Two of the other original members- Ron Donachie and Christopher Ryan left the band before ""Only You"".    ""Only You""- their debut single- was the UK Christmas number one in 1983 spending a total of five weeks at the top- and also doing well around Europe and in Canada- where it hit #17 in the spring of 1984. It emulated the success of the original Yazoo version.    Despite the radical Socialist politics of The Flying Pickets then Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher proclaimed to much amusement that it was her favourite record.[4] A second single- featuring Van McCoy's ""When You're Young and in Love"" originally written for Ruby and the Romantics reached number 7 in the UK- but their third- a cover of the Eurythmics' ""Who's That Girl"" barely charted.    The height of the group's fame coincided with the 1984 Miners Strike. In 1984 the National Union of Mineworkers called strike action following the National Coal Board's decision to close 20 pits and lay off 20-000 people.[2] The Flying Pickets were very vocal regarding their support of the miners during the dispute and came to blows with the record label Virgin after they picketed Drax Power Station in Yorkshire.[5] They also performed benefit gigs for the miners. Hibbard himself claimed that their political beliefs probably had a detrimental effect regarding the group's mainstream image but it was a sacrifice they were willing to make-[6] one well known record store refused to sell the groups albums due to their support of strike action.[7]    In 1986 Hibbard and Stripe left the band and were replaced by Gary Howard and Hereward Kaye.[8] Hibbard and Stripe tried to stay in the music industry- forming their own act called Brian and Stripe but their first and only single featuring a cover of Yazoo's Mr Blue failed to chart- and they returned to their separate acting careers.    The Flying Pickets' line-up has been changing constantly throughout the years- but the band never died; since the Pickets began- there have been about 27 different band members. The last member of the original line-up- David Brett- left the band in 1990.[9] However in 1994- the original line-up (minus Lloyd) reformed to record one more album.[10]    Although since 1990 none of the founding members is part of the band anymore- The Flying Pickets keep recording albums and touring all over Europe and abroad.

The group went on touring all over the world- then scored their biggest hit with 'Build me up Buttercup' which went straight to No.1 all over the world including America. Other hits include 'Bad bad old days' and 'Back on my feet again.' Originally a Ska/Reggae/ band called 'The Ramongs' fronted by two lead singers- they lived in a basement club & former gambling den called 'The Butterfly Club'- sometimes not surfacing for several days. When someone suggested a name change for the band- their Guitarist Alan Warner came up with the name 'The Foundations' to go with the Tamla Motown/soul style of music that they were getting more into. When one of the singers left the band to occupy a room for six months at Her Majesty's pleasure- Joan- a friend of the band- suggested a replacement singer called 'Arthur Brown'- (later to find worldwide fame as The god of hellfire with 'The crazy world of Arthur Brown'). He joined the band for about six weeks gigging in and around London. When Arthur left to do his own thing- they landed a couple of tours backing 'The Toys'- ('Lover's concerto'). Then American Soul Legend 'Edwin Starr'- ('S.O.S-' 'OO soul'- 'and 'War what is it good for'). They carried on running the club- until they were eventually forced out by a protection racket gang. They moved into a squalid disused Mini-cab office next door- where they were discovered by Ron Fairway who introduced them to businessman Barry Class. Seeing the potential of making big bucks from a band which was totally different to all the other bands at that time- (they were all from different races -unusual for that time)-and were playing soul music- Class put the band on a retainer whilst Ron Fairway set about trying to secure gigs. All came to nothing until one day he introduced them to A & R man Tony Macauley. He set up a recording session where they laid down some soul/R & B covers. He then said he would like them to try out a song that he and co writer- John McCloud had written- called 'Baby now that I've found you'. 'Baby now that I-ve found you' was recorded on an 8 track machine at Pye Studios in the summer of 1967- and after a slow start- it started climbing the charts- where it reached No.1 in the UK- and 18 in America. Another couple of records followed. 'Back on my feet again' and 'Any old time you're lonely and sad'- both became top twenty hits. Their lead singer Clem Curtis then left the band to pursue a solo career- and was replaced by Colin Young. They cut the next record 'Build me up Buttercup' which was written by Mike D'abo- (frontman for the hugely popular group- 'Manfred Mann')- & Tony Macauley. Mike Da'bo also played piano on the recording which went to number one all over the world- (except the UK where it reached number two). The next single 'Bad Bad old days' was also a huge hit. This was followed by some minor chart entries and then the band- exhausted after four years of relentless- non stop touring around the world- finally split up around 1971.,106,835,26,323867,nullFour Lads,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcze7EGorOk,Wcze7EGorOk,The Four Lads -  Istanbul (not Constantinople),"Istanbul (Not Constantinople) is a 1953 swing-style song- with lyrics by Jimmy Kennedy and music by Nat Simon.

Seldom has a performer been strongly considered for an Academy Award in both acting and music- yet Frank Stallone has managed to pull it off. His fiery portrayal of a brutish bartender Eddie in the film Barfly had Hollywood insiders abuzz at Oscar time- and his #1 hit Far From Over- from the film Staying Alive- was likewise touted for a 'Best Song' nomination. Its all in a days work for Frank a gifted artist who is equally comfortable on screen or on the concert stage. This Grammy and Golden Globe nominated artist has been everything from a street singer- a rock singer- to a big band singer. Frank was also nominated for a Grammy for best soundtrack and a Golden Globe for Best Original Song from the film Staying Alive. Frank has written songs for 11 films-and has recorded 8 solo albums and has had his music on the Billboard charts 8 times and still plays to SRO crowds in arenas and concert halls from Los Angeles to London. Frank made his on-screen singing debut- performing the self-penned song- sung acapella - 'Take You Back'- in the opening scene of the film ROCKY in 1976. Frank has appeared in over 58 movies. One of his most memorable on- screen appearances was his role as Ed Bailey- a dangerous gunslinger in Tombstone- and as Eddie the bartender in Barfly- which gave rise to serious consideration for Frank for an Academy Award nomination- and won the acclaim of renowned film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times. Barfly is a terrific film that features an outstanding performance by Frank Stallonehes both captivating and terrifying at the same time! On stage Frank is a natural performer. His singing- guitar playing and broad experience of playing all over the world has given him an edge as a performer. I cant wait to get out there and sing- notes Frank. That same kind of upbeat anticipation colors every creative endeavor he undertakes. Franks lifelong musical journey continues- and his enthusiasm for entertaining remains unshaken.,592,1776,45,700936,nullFrank Stallone,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHuwQBE8vmw,XHuwQBE8vmw,Frank Stallone - Take You Back- Live in Australia 2010,Frank Stallone - Take You Back- Live in Melbourne Australia 2010. 18-8-10.

Het is een vertaling van Michel van der Plas van het lied Her song van Jake Holmes- van diens album So Close- So Very Far to Go uit 1970.

A broken heart that just won't mend  is the price you pay.      It's hard to take when love grows old.  The days are long and the nights turn cold  when it fades away.      You hope that she will change her mind-  but the days drift on and on.  You'll never know the reason why she's gone.      You see her face in every crowd.  You hear her voice- but you're still proud-  so you turn away.      You tell yourself that you'll be strong.  But your heart tells you-  this time you're wrong.      You hope that she will change her mind-  but the days drift on and on.  You'll never know the reason why she's gone.      Empty rooms-  where we learn to live without love.  Empty rooms-  where we learn to live without love.  Empty rooms-  where we learn to live without love.      Empty rooms-  where we learn to live without love.  Empty rooms-  where we learn to live without love.  Empty rooms-  where we learn to live without love.  Empty rooms-  where we learn to live without love.      All alone in an empty room.

From the album: Invisible Touch.    ""Land of Confusion"" is a rock song written by the band Genesis for their 1986 album Invisible Touch. The song was the third track on the album and was the fourth track from the album to become a single- which reached #4 in the US and #14 in the UK in 1987. It made #8 in the Netherlands. The music was written by the band- while the lyrics were written by guitarist Mike Rutherford. The song is remembered by many Genesis fans because of its video- which featured puppets from the 1980s UK sketch show Spitting Image.

Originally released on VHS to coincide with the live album of the same name. It has only ever been released digitally. Originally filmed in 16mm, the footage has now been fully restored and is being reissued. The show focuses on tracks from the _DukeÓ and _AbacabÓ albums and the tracks are intercut with behind the scenes footage and interviews with the band members. As ever with Genesis, the show is visually stunning and it captures the band in their transition from their progressive days in the seventies through to the hugely successful pop/rock act they became from the mid-eighties onwards. Genesis have always been great live performers and _Three Sides LiveÓ is a great addition to any fans collection.Available week of November 3rd 2014TRACKLISTING:1) Behind The Lines 2) Duchess 3) Misunderstanding 4) Dodo / Lurker 5) Abacab 6) No Reply At All 7) Who Dunnit? 8) Medley: In The Cage / The Cinema Show / The Colony Of Slippermen 9) Afterglow 10) Me & Sarah Jane 11) Man On The Corner 12) Turn It On AgainLike and Share our videos to encourage us to post more.Subscribe to our channel for more live concert footage: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...Eagle Records Audio YT Channel:http://www.youtube.com/EagleRockSoundsSign up to our mailing list: http://eepurl.com/zSiz1Follow us on twitter, Facebook and google plus:https://www.facebook.com/EagleRockEnthttps://twitter.com/EagleRocknewshttp://www.muzu.tv/eaglerockentertain...https://www.google.com/+eaglerock",113,475,12,119712,nullGeorge Baker Selection,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L1hD5OlPtw,0L1hD5OlPtw,George Baker Selection Little Green Bag,George Baker Selection Little Green Bag reservoir dogs theme,2397,11885,169,3256804,nullGeorge Baker Selection,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4USiP6QXRmA,4USiP6QXRmA,George Baker Selection Manolito Live,George Baker Selection Manolito Live,71,333,17,435714,nullGeorge Benson,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imYJpr09IgQ,imYJpr09IgQ,George Benson - Give Me The Night,"-1980- Full vinyl 12"" absolute classic.",3824,40445,559,10317089,nullGeorge Benson,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn27IcAapPI,_eXO7hrq2AY,george benson - Take Five 1976 Montreux 1986,"You've been waiting for !

Please stay I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool I should have known better than to cheat a friend And waste a chance that I'd been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you (Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone (Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong?

Yeh!,"Georgie Fame (born Clive Powell- 26 June 1943- Leigh- Lancashire) is a British rhythm and blues and jazz singer and keyboard player. The one-time rock and roll tour musician- who had a string of 1960s hits- is still a popular performer- often working with contemporaries such as Van Morrison and Bill Wyman.  Fame took piano lessons from the age of seven and after leaving Leigh Central County Secondary School at 15- he worked for a brief period in a cotton weaving mill and played piano for a band called The Dominoes in the evenings. After taking part in a singing contest at the Butlins Holiday Camp in Pwllheli- North Wales he was offered a job there by the band leader- early British rock'n'roll star Rory Blackwell.  At sixteen years of age- Fame went to London and- on the recommendation of Lionel Bart- entered into a management agreement with Larry Parnes- who had given new stage names to such artists as Marty Wilde and Billy Fury. Fame later recalled that Parnes had given him an ultimatum over his forced change of name:"" It was very much against my will but he said- ""If you don't use my name- I won't use you in the show"". ""   Over the following year he toured the UK playing beside Wilde- Joe Brown- Gene Vincent- Eddie Cochran and others. Fame played piano for Billy Fury in his backing band The Blue Flames. When the backing band got the sack at the end of 1961- the band were re-billed as ""Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames"" and went on to enjoy great success with a repertoire largely of rhythm and blues numbers.

He had been booked weeks beforehand and because he was ""Glen Campbell"" he was asked to do four songs on the show as opposed to the three everyone else had been asked to do previously- what they were going to be was still undecided. So we get to the actual week of the show and myself and the show's producer Alan Boyd are still none the wiser as to what songs he is going to sing. He was touring the UK at the time and his management were proving rather tricky to get a hold of. Numerous emails- phone calls... nothing!  Alan- Adrian Fry (my assistant musical director) and I were starting to worry that we wouldn't have arrangements written for the 11-piece band in time for the broadcast on the Sunday. Then on the Wednesday- three days before the Saturday morning rehearsal- we finally get a message back from his management telling us two of the four songs- 'Wichita Lineman' and 'Southern Nights' and that the keys were as the originals. We went to work on those and by the Thursday night having not heard anything further from them about the other two songs- Alan made the decision that we should write one more arrangement for 'Rhinestone Cowboy' and that would be it. I would normally have had some contact with his musical director to find out things like if there were any new updated live arrangement changes that we should make compared to the originals- what guitar parts needed to be covered by my guitarist- how the songs ended etc etc. Either way- we wrote the last arrangement and would make any changes Glen wanted to make at the rehearsal on Saturday.  On the Friday afternoon- we heard from the management. They told us that Glen wasn't going to be able to make the rehearsal the next day and that he was now only going to do two numbers ('Southern Nights' and 'Gentle On My Mind') and that the band would only be needed for one of those and that he wouldn't need me to play piano (which I was gutted about) as he was going to use his own piano-player. Very tricky situation because had it not been a legend we were dealing with and it not been only a day away from the show- I'm sure the BBC would have told them who was boss. But we also made the assumption that none of this was coming from Glen Campbell himself. As it turned out- we were absolutely correct and I realise now that his entourage were protecting him from what only they knew at the time which was that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and understandably didn't want to take unnecessary risks live on national radio.  We made the decision that along with the rest of the show- we would go ahead without him on the Saturday morning and rehearse the arrangements we had written in the hope that when he arrived the following morning- the day of the broadcast- he (or more to the point his management!) would hear the band playing and change their minds at the last minute. Unfortunately- that wasn't to be.  On the Sunday morning at 9.30am- just 90 minutes away from the live broadcast- Glen and his entourage arrived at the Radio Theatre. There were loads of them surrounding him but when he broke free of them and walked onto the stage and put his guitar on and his piano-player started giving directions to my band- I took the opportunity to go over and introduce myself to him as the show's musical director. He was as charming as I'd hoped he would be although I could tell that something wasn't quite right. We spoke briefly about Elvis and Albert Lee and then he asked me what he was going to sing. I told him what had been decided by his management but that we had done full arrangements of 'Wichita Lineman' and 'Rhinestone Cowboy' also- to which he replied ""let's do those too"". He even went over to his piano-player- TJ Kuenster (who was obviously his musical director) and said ""they've got charts for Wichita & Cowboy"" to which TJ replied ""No Glen- we're just going to do Gentle and Southern Nights"". Glen shrugged his shoulders and that was that.  I screen captured Glen's performance and I'm glad I did as this- unfortunately- may turn out to be his very last live appearance and interview for the BBC.  At the end of 'Southern Nights' he exclaims ""WOW! WHAT A BAND!"" and even though I wasn't playing- this is one of the proudest moments of my career as that was MY band he was talking about- hand-picked over many years and that was mine and Adrian's arrangement he'd just enjoyed singing to. You can see him turn round at the end as if he wanted to keep going and do another song... or two! As I say- it wasn't to be.  I knew I was meeting 'music royalty' when I met him that morning and I was in awe of him and despite his illness- he gave an incredible performance. I wish I could go back and have those two hours again but at least I have this precious recording and with it- in some ways- I'll always be able to.

Kept tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart!  And I spent oh so many nights  just feeling sorry for myself. I used to cry!  But now I hold my head up high.  And you see me somebody new!  I'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you.    And so you feel like droppin' in-  and just expect me to be free-  now I'm saving all my loving for someone who is loving me!

Roy (Troy Dixon)- and Eddie F (born Edward Ferrell). The group maintained a sizable audience in the United States through most of the 1990s. He has recently ventured into reggae music and can now be described as a reggae fusion artist.    Myers was born on May 24- 1967 in Jamaica. His family moved to Mount Vernon- New York- when he was a young child.    Heavy D & the Boyz were the first group signed to Uptown Records; their debut- Living Large- was released in 1987. The album was a commercial success- though Big Tyme was a breakthrough that included four hits. Trouble T. Roy died at age 22 in a fall on July 15- 1990- in Indianapolis. Dixon's passing led to a tribute on the follow-up platinum album- Peaceful Journey. Pete Rock & CL Smooth created a tribute to Trouble T. Roy called ""They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)"" which is regarded as a hip-hop classic.    Heavy D & the Boyz gained even more fame by singing the theme song for the television program In Living Color and also MADtv- and Heavy D performed the rap on Michael Jackson's hit single ""Jam."" However- the group's next album- Blue Funk- was not marketed as well as their previous albums[citation needed]- but is widely viewed as an underrated gem.[citation needed] Heavy D then began focusing on his acting- appearing in the television shows A Different World- Roc and Living Single before returning the music charts with Nuttin' But Love. After appearing in the off-Broadway play Riff Raff at Circle Repertory Company- Heavy D returned to recording with the hit Waterbed Hev.[1] In 2005- the Will Smith movie Hitch played the song ""Now That We Found Love"" during the ending scene where a wedding party does a line dance- and gave Heavy D & the Boyz a lot of exposure- sending many viewers to the web to find out more about the song and the group.    He then appeared in the film Life- before being in the cast of the television show Boston Public. In 2002- Heavy D had a supporting role as an FBI agent alongside Omar Epps in the movie adaptation of Dave Barry's novel Big Trouble. In 2003 he starred in the supporting cast for the sit-com The Tracy Morgan Show as Bernard. In 1997- Heavy D collaborated with B.B. King on his duets album Deuces Wild rapping in the song ""Keep It Coming."" He also has a small role in the 1999 Oscar-nominated movie The Cider House Rules. In 2005- Heavy D appeared as Sid in the hit Fox drama Bones- as the owner and bartender at Wong Fu's. In 2006- he appeared in the motion picture- Step Up- as Omar. Heavy D also appeared as Bo-Kane in the 1995 film New Jersey Drive. Heavy D has now released a new reggae album via iTunes- called Vibes.    Heavy D was referred to in the song ""Juicy"" by the Notorious B.I.G. and in "" Da Girls They Love Me"" by underground rapper R.A. the Rugged Man. He also appears as the bouncer in the music video for ""One More Chance"" by Notorious B.I.G. In the song ""Choppa on Da Back Seat"" by Lil Wyte he says that "" I got Heavy D Tied up on my couch- Face down with a rifle wound bleeding out his mouth"".    Heavy D also played a part in the film ""Big Trouble"" as an FBI agent.    Myers died on November 8- 2011 in Los Angeles- California- at the age of 44. He collapsed outside his Beverly Hills home and was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. It has been reported that his death was due to respiratory issues and that no foul play was involved.    Heavy D was last seen in public in the movie Tower Heist- which premiered only 4 days before his death.

Lead singer Erroll Brown- guitarist Harvey Hinsley- keyboardist Larry Ferguson- bassist Tony Wilson- drummer Tony Connor- and conga player Pat Olive were the original lineup. They recorded for Big Tree from 1975 to 1978- scoring a Top Ten R&B and pop hit with ""You Sexy Thing"" in 1975- which also was a gold single. They repeated the trick in 1978 with ""Every 1's a Winner-"" once more earning a gold single in the process. No other Hot Chocolate song ever made it beyond number 40 on the R&B chart- and their albums never packed much commercial punch either. Wilson departed in 1975- and Olive switched to bass in his place. ~ Ron Wynn- All Music Guide  _______________________________  A 1987 remix by Ben Liebrand hit number 10. It was also covered by Deee-Lite in 1994. When it was featured in the movie- The Full Monty in 1997- it went to number six in the chart. It is the only song to enter the UK Top Ten in the 1970s- 1980s and 1990s.  ""You Sexy Thing"" was covered by Tom Tom Club in 1992 on their album Dark Sneak Love Action. Two more covers were released at almost the same time as the 1997 re-issue of the Hot Chocolate original. Thus- for one week- the UK Singles Chart boasted three versions of the song.

SUBSCRIBE for thousands more live videos and new gigs uploaded weekly: http://www.youtube.com/moshcam  Like Patty Griffin before him- Howie Day emerged from the country quietude of Bangor- ME- into Boston's coffeehouse scene and the world of folk music- proving his talent on his first release- Australia. Singer/songwriters come a dime a dozen- but the truly eloquent ones are priceless- and Day found a place in that lineage. Born in 1981- Day started playing piano as a youngster and eventually took hold of a guitar when he was 14. By the next year- he had his first live gig at Captain Nick's. Within another two years- Day was touring full-time in support of his independently released debut. Citing the likes of Jeff Buckley- Radiohead- and Dave Matthews among his influences- Day incorporated these artists' defining characteristics into his style while still striking out an original sound. Being without the resources of a major label's backing never hindered his touring schedule- as Day opened for everyone from the Wallflowers and Shawn Mullins to Remy Zero and David Gray. He issued the Australia LP in 2000 through his own Daze imprint- and continued gigging relentlessly- both in Boston and beyond. The strong word of mouth found its way to Sony- who put Day on the payroll and re-released a slightly cleaned-up Australia in June 2002. ""Ghost"" was a minor hit at modern rock radio- and the exposure only strengthened Day's college-age constituency. The Madrigals EP appeared in April 2003; it featured demo and live material and acted as a setup man for Day's official Sony (Epic Records) bow. When ""Stop All the World Now"" appeared that October- it was an ambitious- richly produced record that revealed a newfound maturity in Day's voice and songwriting. Singles like ""Perfect Time of Day"" and ""Collide"" did pretty well- and Day continued to tour in support of the album through 2005. Toward the end of that year he released the ""Live From..."" EP. Howie has spent most of 2008 finishing up a new album which will be released in early 2009.",7,49,1,8892,nullHues Corporation,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n25cEe-1mQ,-n25cEe-1mQ,How I Wish We Could Do It All Again - Hues Corporation,Sweet soul review of the 70s.,56,301,9,150289,nullHues Corporation,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzNZmD9KujA,xzNZmD9KujA,Hues Corporation-Rock the Boat-Live,"The Hues Corp. performing ""Rock the Boat"" live on Rock Concert circa 1975",1,20,1,5290,nullHuey Lewis and The News,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCkgYhtz64U,KCkgYhtz64U,Huey Lewis and the News - Power of Love (Official Video),A Music Video of Power of Love by Huey Lewis and the News,243,2193,52,486057,nullHuey Lewis and The News,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdzNyG86fs,dq-S341OsgU,Huey Lewis And The News - The Power Of Love (Live) - BBC1 - Monday 31st August 1987,Taken from a Concert shown on BBC1 on Monday 31st August 1987,210,1337,20,359302,nullHuman Beinz,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Us1ASENPws,5Us1ASENPws,Nobody but me - The human beinz (HQ),"The Human Beinz is an American band from Youngstown- Ohio.

Love live music? SUBSCRIBE for thousands more live videos and new gigs uploaded weekly: http://www.youtube.com/moshcam  Icehouse is an Australian rock band- formed as Flowers in 1977 in Sydney. Initially known in Australia for their pub rock style- they later achieved mainstream success playing new wave and synthpop style music and attained Top Ten singles chart success in both Europe and the U.S. The mainstay of both Flowers and Icehouse has been Iva Davies (singer-songwriter- record producer- guitar- bass- keyboards- oboe) supplying additional musicians as required. The name Icehouse- which was adopted in 1981- comes from an old- cold flat Davies lived in and the strange building across the road populated by itinerant people.  Icehouse's iconic status was acknowledged when they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame on 16 August 2006. ARIA described Icehouse as ""one of the most successful Australian bands of the eighties and nineties... With an uncompromising approach to music production they created songs that ranged from pure pop escapism to edgy- lavish synthesised pieces..."" Icehouse has produced eight Top Ten albums and twenty Top Forty singles in Australia- multiple top ten hits in Europe and North America and album sales of over 28 times Platinum in Australasia alone. As of 2006- Man of Colours was still the highest selling album in Australia by an Australian band.",33,171,2,36569,nullIcona Pop,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxxajLWwzqY,UxxajLWwzqY,Icona Pop - I Love It (feat.

From the age of 16- she was turning up on television and in films- including a part in the TV mini-series Roots 2 in 1979. In 1980- she was catapulted into stardom and a singing career by her appearance in the film Fame- for which she sang the title song- an Oscar-winning Top Ten hit. Also from the film was her Top 40 hit ""Out Here on My Own."" In 1983- she topped the charts with ""Flashdance...What a Feelin'"" from the movie Flashdance- a song she co-wrote that won another Oscar- and Cara won a couple of Grammys for her contributions to the soundtrack. Her What a Feelin' album included the hits ""Why Me?"" and ""Breakdance-"" and she also made the Top 40 with a third movie theme- ""The Dream (Hold on to Your Dream)-"" from DC Cab. ~ William Ruhlmann- All Music Guide Jennifer Beals stars as Alex Owens- a Pittsburgh steel-mill welder by day- and bar dancer by night. Harboring dreams of a career in ballet- she is given financial support in this endeavor by her boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri) and moral support by demanding but big-hearted instructor Hanna Long (Lilia Skala). The film's signature scene is- of course- Alex's water-drenched dance audition- largely performed in long shot by her dance double Marine Jahan. Essentially an old-fashioned backstage yarn- Flashdance was given a contemporary spin by its pulsating- musical score featuring the Oscar-winning Best Song- Flashdance...What a Feeling- (music by Giorgio Moroder- lyrics by Keith Forsey and Irene Cara).

You can call out my name... when you're only lonely-  Now- don't you ever be ashamed- you're only lonely-    When you need somebody around on the nights that try you-  (Remember) I was there when you were a queen-  And I'll be the last one there beside you.  So you can call out my name... when you're only lonely.  Now- don't you ever be ashamed- you're only lonely-      When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders-  And when you're feeling lonely and small-  You need somebody there to hold you.  So don't you ever be ashamed- you're only lonely.  Ah- you can call out my name... when you're only lonely-    When you're only lonely...  Ah- it's no crime... darling- we've got lots of time.    Ah- there's nothing wrong with you...  Darling- I get lonely- too.    So if you need me- all you gotta do is call me.  You're only lonely,646,2869,78,939978,nullJ.D.

After hearing a demo of him singing 'Just Once'- Quincy Jones asked Ingram to perform on his new album in 1980- The Dude. The song- 'Just Once' was Ingram's first success- resulting in three Grammy nominations _ Best New Artist- Best Pop Male Vocal- and Best R&B Vocal _ winning in the two latter categories. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s- Ingram had steady popular success singing duets- as well as songwriting. On that note- Ingram wrote 'P.Y.T : Pretty Young Thing' for the late Michael Jackson- for his Thriller album. He was also took part in the multi-artist collaboration song- 'We Are The World' in 1985. His solo albums didn't score high on the charts until 1990- when he scored his first solo hits- 'I Don't Have the Heart'- and 'Its Real'- which was a New Jack Swing R&B hit produced by Teddy Riley and the late Gene Griffin. Also in 1990- he was in the multi-artist collaboration on the well known love ballad 'Secret Garden' from the Back On The Block album from Quincy Jones. In the 1990s Ingram recorded two albums: two of them are his best-of compilations. Ingram brings down to earth realness and truth to every song that he writes and produces.,295,2578,56,609873,nullJames Ingram,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BceqQyMq6fU,BceqQyMq6fU,James Ingram - Just Once (Live in Korea),"Don't forget to subscribe for more exclusive videos: http://bit.ly/GzElZS!

Does anyone have more acetates from Cliffie's shows? I can process them to digital for you.I'm not looking to make money I only do it because I believe it is important for people to hear what a talented group of people they were and a important part of S. California music history.Also interested in film or photos-any year and any artist who appeared on the show-all would be very helpful.   The Cliffie Stone Hometown Jamboree band members may very some-but this is who I think is playing on most of these cuts (Merrill Moore - Piano) (Speedy West - Pedal Steel) (Harold Hensley - Fiddle) (Billy Strange - Guitar) ( Al Williams - Bass) (Roy Harte - Drums) (Billy Liebert - Accordion). Most of these acetates are from 1956 thru late 1959.,0,1,0,123,nullJeannie C. Riley,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ivUOnnstpg,4ivUOnnstpg,Harper Valley P.T.A. movie clip / singer  Jeannie C. Riley,"Jeanne Riley had cut a demo record for one of her songwriter friends- Royce Clark called ""The Old Town Drunk."" It was a sarcastic ballad of the old drunk that everyone in town made fun of until one day when they found his hat floating in the river and his shoes next to the river bank. The whole town got concerned and started dragging the river looking for his body. All the while the old town drunk was on the hillside- overlooking the entire scene- laughing. He finally came down and told the folks he was glad he was so well thought of.    When the song was played for producer Shelby Singleton of Plantation records. He wanted to know- ""who's that girl doing the singing?"" Shelby had been presented a song from a struggling songwriter named Tom Hall called ""Harper Valley P.T.A."" but he was not sold on the song due to the arrangement and the voice of the singer on the demo. It was a definite copy of the song ""Ode to Billy Joe"" which was a hit a year prior. The voice of the singer was just too smooth- he thought. This song need punch and sarcasm. But once he heard Jeannie's rendition of ""The Old Town Drunk-"" it clicked. And he said- get me that girl and a song I've got called ""Harper Valley P.T.A."" and I will cut you a million seller.    On friday- July 26- 1968 Jeannie had been working for Passkey Music on Music Row as a receptionist. She closed the door to the office at 5 o'clock and walked next door to Columbia Studio. It was a hot- humid evening. The producer- Shelby Singleton- kept saying the song was ""just right"" for her voice- just right to catch the angry mood of a nation fed up with hypocrisy. Jeannie glanced at the music and listened as Jerry Kennedy- the session leader- begin his cadence countdown. She began to tap her foot to the beat- she stepped up to the microphone. Suddenly she was into the song.    From the very fist word her mood and lyrics came together in a magical blend.  She stood close to the mike and let it pour out. There wasn't a sound as the last echo of the guitars faded. Then one of the musicians said ""Great Gawd A'mighty.""    It had taken 15 minutes to cut the first tape. Then someone suggested that they change the line ""... the day that momma broke up the Harper Valley P.T.A."" to ""...the day my momma socked it to- the Harper Valley P.T.A."" The lyrics- the music- literally made Jeannie the Harper Valley girl. Caught up in it- she snorted and sneered the anger of the world. That was it. What the world heard was what was done that Friday night in July 1968 by Jeannie C. Riley.",1237,10278,237,3209806,nullJeannie C.

With my best old ex-friend Ray  A guy she said she knew well 'n' sometimes hated    Isn't that the way they say it goes  But let's forget all that  And give me the number if you can find it  So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show  I've overcome the blow  I've learned to take it well  I only wish my words could just convince myself  That it just wasn't real  But that's not the way it feels    Operator- oh could you help me place this call  'Cause I can't read the number that you just gave me  There's something in my eyes  You know it happens every time  I think about the love that I thought would save me    Isn't that the way they say it goes  But let's forget all that  And give me the number if you can find it  So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show  I've overcome the blow  I've learned to take it well  I only wish my words could just convince myself  That it just wasn't real  But that's not the way it feels    No- no- no- no- that's not the way it feels    Operator- oh let's forget about this call  There's no one there I really wanted to talk to  Thank you for your time  Oh you've been so much more than kind  And you can keep the dime    Isn't that the way they say it goes  But let's forget all that  And give me the number if you can find it  So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show  I've overcome the blow  I've learned to take it well  I only wish my words could just convince myself  That it just wasn't real  But that's not the way it feels,2370,12767,251,3102825,nullJim Jones,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btVTj1fVFaY,btVTj1fVFaY,Jim Jones Juelz Sanata Waka Flocka - 848 Official Video,,641,3434,160,1260735,nullJim Jones,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaUqL7uDp1c,SaUqL7uDp1c,Cam'ron- Juelz Santana- Jim Jones & Freekey Zekey -- Salute live @ BET Hip-Hop Awards (Video),Cam'ron- Juelz Santana- Jim Jones & Freekey Zekey -- Salute live @ BET Hip-Hop Awards (Video),48,277,10,126138,nullJim Reeves,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nECoA-uVGfw,nECoA-uVGfw,Jim Reeves - I Love You Because,Jim Reeves in Concert in Oslo 1964,1117,5870,278,3715302,nullJim Reeves,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlf41gHf0jw,zlf41gHf0jw,"Jim Reeves Performing ""Welcome To My World"" LIVE on The Jimmy Dean Show 1964",Here is another clip from the new The Very Best Of The Jimmy Dean Show brought to you by Legend Flix and Global Vision Entertainment.

His easy going manner- fine voice- superb songwriting and dedication to environmental issues all combined to build a huge global fanbase that has continued to grow since his untimely death in a plane crash in 1997. This superb 5 disc set is the definitive John Denver DVD release. There are three complete live performances with full band from Australia in 1977- Japan in 1981 and England in 1986. These are complemented by a solo acoustic performance from Japan in 1984 and his performances at Farm Aid from 1985- 1987 & 1990. The final disc has two hour long documentaries made by John Denver- his 1990 Earth Day programme about environmental issues and his 1972 show about the Bighorn sheep of his beloved Rocky Mountains.  He was born in the summer of his 27th year Comin' home to a place he'd never been before He left yesterday behind him- you might say he was born again You might say he found a key for every door  When he first came to the mountains his life was far away On the road and hangin' by a song But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long  But the Colorado rocky mountain high I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye Rocky mountain high  He climbed cathedral mountains- he saw silver clouds below He saw everything as far as you can see And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun And he lost a friend but kept his memory  Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams Seeking grace in every step he takes His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake  And the Colorado rocky mountain high I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply Rocky mountain high  Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more More people- more scars upon the land  And the Colorado rocky mountain high I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly Rocky mountain high  It's Colorado rocky mountain high I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky Friends around the campfire and everybody's high Rocky mountain high,640,3523,70,1188301,nullJohn Farnham,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbkOZTSvrHs,tbkOZTSvrHs,John Farnham - You're the Voice,Music video by John Farnham performing You're The Voice.

In August 1896- three people led by Skookum Jim Mason (a member of the Tagish nation whose birth name was Keish) headed up the Yukon River from the Carcross area looking for his sister Kate and her husband George Carmack. The party included Skookum Jim- Skookum Jim's cousin known as Dawson Charlie (or sometimes Tagish Charlie) and his nephew Patsy Henderson. After meeting up with George and Kate who were fishing for salmon at the mouth of the Klondike River- they ran into Nova Scotian Robert Henderson who had been mining gold on the Indian River- just south of the Klondike. Henderson told George Carmack about where he was mining and that he did not want any ""damn Siwashes"" (meaning Indians) near him. The group then headed a few miles up the Klondike River to Rabbit Creek- now Bonanza Creek to hunt moose.    On August 16- 1896- the party discovered rich placer gold deposits in Bonanza (Rabbit) Creek. It is now generally accepted that Skookum Jim made the actual discovery- but some accounts say that it was Kate Carmack. George Carmack was officially credited for the discovery because the ""discovery"" claim was staked in his name. The group agreed to this because they felt that other miners would be reluctant to recognise a claim made by an Indian- given the strong racist attitudes of the time. Further evidence of Skookum Jim's discovery is that he was eagerly followed by other miners and caused a mini rush when he later staked some claims in the Kluane Lake area in 1905.    The news spread to other mining camps in the Yukon River valley- and the Bonanza- Eldorado and Hunker Creeks were rapidly staked by miners who had been previously working creeks and sandbars on the Fortymile and Stewart Rivers. In a fate that many believe to be poetic justice- Henderson- who was mining only a few miles away over the hill- only found out about the discovery after the rich creeks had been all staked.    News reached the United States on July 17- 1897 when the first successful prospectors arrived in Seattle- and within a month the Klondike stampede had begun. The population in the Klondike in 1898 may have reached 40-000- threatening to cause a famine.    Most prospectors landed at Skagway at the head of Lynn Canal and crossed by the Chilkoot Trail or White Pass to Bennett Lake. Here- prospectors built boats that would take them the final 500 miles (800 km) down the Yukon River to the gold fields. Stampeders had to carry one ton of goods over the pass to be allowed to enter Canada. At the top of the passes- the stampeders encountered a Mountie post that enforced that regulation. It was put in place to avert shortages like those that had occurred in the previous two winters in Dawson City.    The Chilkoot Pass was steep and hazardous- rising a thousand feet in the last half mile (300 m in 800 m). It was too steep for pack animals and prospectors had to pack their equipment and supplies to the top. Some 1-500 steps were carved into the ice to aid travel up the pass.     Even though it was not as high- conditions on White Pass were even worse. It was known as the Dead Horse Trail with about 3-000 animals dying along the route.     Others took the Copper River Trail or the Teslin Trail by Stikine River and Teslin Lake- and some used the all-Canadian Ashcroft and Edmonton trails. The other main route was by steamer about 2600 kilometers (1600 miles) up the Yukon River. Many using this route late in 1897 were caught by winter ice below Fort Yukon- Alaska and had to be rescued.    An estimated 100-000 people participated in the gold rush and about 30-000 made it to Dawson City in 1898. By 1901- when the first census was taken- the population had declined to 9-000.    Throughout this period- the North West Mounted Police- under the command of Sam Steele maintained a firm grip on the activities of the prospectors to ensure the safety of the population as well as enforcing the laws and sovereignty of Canada. As a result- this gold rush has been described as the most peaceful and orderly of its type in history. The effectiveness of the Mounties in this period made the police force famous around the world- and ensured the survival of the organization at a time when its continued operation was being debated in the Canadian Parliament.    The gold rush remains an important event in the history of the city of Edmonton- which to this day celebrates Klondike Days- an annual summer fair with a Klondike gold rush theme.    Among the many to take part in the gold rush was writer Jack London- whose books White Fang and The Call of the Wild were influenced by his northern experiences- and adventurer ""Swiftwater"" Bill Gates.",338,10676,268,4137250,nullJohnny Horton,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgw8UYAxMgY,wgw8UYAxMgY,"Johnny Horton ""Sink the Bismark""",Saturday Night Beech-Nut Show.

On the most obvious level- he was a rock star of the 1960s and a true rarity as a white American singer/guitarist who made a name for himself as a straight-ahead rock & roller during the middle of that decade. Just as important behind the scenes- his recordings and their success led to the launching- directly and indirectly- of at least three record labels and a dozen other careers whose influence extended into the 1970s- 1980s- and beyond.   Rivers was very much a kindred spirit to figures like Buddy Holly and Ronnie Hawkins- with all of the verve and spirit of members of that first wave of rock & rollers. He had the misfortune of having been born a little too late to catch that wave- however- and took until the middle of the next decade to find his audience. Born John Henry Ramistella on November 7- 1942- in New York- his family moved to Baton Rouge- LA- in 1948- and it was there that his musical sensibilities were shaped. His father- who played the mandolin and guitar- introduced him to the guitar at an early age- and he proved a natural on the instrument.   Meanwhile- Ramistella also began absorbing the R&B sounds that were starting to turn up on the airwaves at the dawn of the 1950s. Additionally- he got to see performers like Fats Domino and Jimmy Reed in person- and by the time he entered his teens- he was immersed in rhythm & blues. He was also good enough to start playing guitar in local groups and at age 13- he formed his own band- the Spades- playing New Orleans-flavored R&B and rock & roll- especially Fats Domino- Larry Williams- and Little Richard. Ramistella made his recording debut leading the Spades in 1956 with the song ""Hey Little Girl-"" issued on the Suede label.   In 1957- he went to New York and wangled a meeting with Alan Freed- who was then the most influential disc jockey in the country. This led to a change of name- at Freed's suggestion- to the less ethnic- more American-mythic Johnny Rivers (which may also have been influenced by the fact that Elvis Presley had portrayed a character named ""Deke Rivers"" in the movie Loving You that same year)- and to a series of single releases under his new name. Johnny Rivers' official recording debut took place with an original song- ""Baby Come Back-"" on George Goldner's Gone Records label in 1958- arranged by renowned songwriter Otis Blackwell. Neither this number -- which sounds a lot like Elvis Presley's version of Blackwell's ""Don't Be Cruel"" -- nor any of Rivers' other early singles- recorded for Guyden- Cub- Era- or Chancellor- was successful. He made his living largely performing with the Spades and cutting demos of songs for Hill & Range- primarily in Elvis Presley's style.   It was as a composer that Rivers experienced his first taste of success off of the stage- when a chance meeting with guitarist James Burton led to one of his songs- ""I'll Make Believe-"" finding its way to Ricky Nelson and ending up on the album More Songs by Ricky. By 1961- he was 18 years old and a veteran performer with six years' professional performing under his belt and relatively little to show for it except the experience; even a lot of the established figures in the business who'd tried to give him various breaks over the years- including Alan Freed and George Goldner- had fallen on hard times by then. He moved to Los Angeles and began aiming for a career as a songwriter and producer.   Fate played its hand in 1963- however- when a friend who ran a restaurant in Los Angeles appealed to Rivers for help when his house band- a jazz group- suddenly quit. He reluctantly agreed to perform for a few nights in a stripped-down version of his rock & roll act- with just his electric guitar and a drummer- Eddie Rubin. That was when lightning struck -- it turned out that audiences at the restaurant liked the way he sang and played- and soon the crowds were growing and his performing stint turned into an open-ended engagement. Bassist Joe Osborn was hired to join the combo and fill out the sound and suddenly seeing Johnny Rivers was becoming the thing to do.  ~ Bruce Eder- All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Bill Drummond and Jimi Cauty applied the tactics of punk shock-terrorism to late-'80s acid house and became one of Britain's best-selling artists (recording also as the JAMS and the Timelords) just before their retirement in 1992. The duo then deleted their entire back catalog _ a potential loss in the millions of pounds _ and declared they wouldn't release another record until peace was declared throughout the world.

The single was written by Jimmy Harry and produced by Clif Magness. The song is notable for being the first single in which Clarkson explores the ""pop rock"" element that would later define her career in singles like ""Breakaway"" and ""Since U Been Gone""- however the intro guitar riff gives the song a minor R&B element. It opens with a guitar chord strum- played backwards.

And I am the lady in your world. And loving each other's how we work. (Oh)    1st Verse:  Trust. Without it there's no love. It's true no matter what you try. Us- There can be no us unless we find the strength to fight.    Bridge:  I spy- you seek. You watch- I peek. So what are we doin' with our love? It's not how it's posed' to be.

Original show canceled February 4th- postponed to March 11th - which means what? 2 plane tickets to see Kelly Price who is ALWAYS worth the ticket price.  Kelly has old school professional performance training and DELIVERED though it was probably 400 people at a 4000 seat venue.    This show was poorly handled. MARJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! Again- Kelly Price and Marsha Ambrosius did their thing. NOTE TO MARSHA and KELLY! Do not EVER again allow another promoter to handle you this way as you were handled/presented in this show. Folks like me who will travel out of state as your fan to see you deserve better. It was offensive how this show was handled. And for me- it's not just the concert ticket price but my flight- hotel- travel to and from venue that's considered. By a great promoter- for me - all of it would have been worth it. Actually- to bare witness to Kelly's voice again (like 10 times live) and Marsha's now for the 3rd time- it was still worth it FOR ME! But for the average concert goer- this show was poorly handled and offensive. First Mind Entertainment and/or The Ritz Theatre in Elizabeth- NJ - you've got to do better.

Some guys- some guys are only about (About!) That thing- that thing- that thing! (Thing!) That thing- that thing- that thing! (Thing!) Throw your hands in the air! Admit two shots in the atmosphere! Verse 1 It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend The one you let hit it and never called you again Remember when he told you he was about the benjamins? You act like you ain't here him- but gave him a little trim To begin- how you think you're really going to pretend Like you wasn't down and you called him again? Plus when- you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him If you did it then- then you'd probably do it again Talking out your neck- saying you're a Christian A Muslim- sleeping with the Gin Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin? Showing off your a-- because your thinking it's a trend Girlfriend- let me break it down for you again! You know I only say it because i'm truly genuine Don't be a hard rock- when you really are a gem Baby girl! Respect is just the minimum brothas creepin' and you still defending him Now -- Lauryn is only human Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in Look at what you be in- hair weaves like Europeans Fake nails up out Koreans Come again Yo! A-When when come again! (Yeah-Yeah!) When when come again!! (Yeah-Yeah!) My friend come again!!! (Yeah-Yeah!) Chorus Guys you know you'd better- watch out (Watch out!) Some girls- some girls are only- about (About!) That thing- that thing- that thing! (Thing!) That thing- that thing- that thing! (Thing!) Verse 2 The second verse is dedicated to the men More concerned with his rims and his Tim's than his women Him and his men- come in the club like houligans Don't care who they offend Popping game (Like you got yen!) Let's stop pretend- the ones that pack pistols by they waste men Cristall by the case men- still living in his Mother's basement The pretty face men claiming that they be the ""big men."" Need to take care of their three and four kids But they face a court case when the child support's late Money taking and heart breaking Now you wonder why women hate men The sneaky silent men The punk domestic violence men Too quick to shoot the scene- stop acting like boys and be men! How you gonna win- when you ain't right within?! How you gonna win- when you ain't right within?! How you gonna win- when you ain't right within?! Unh-Unhh Come Again! Bro-Straight come again! Sit straight come again! Watch out- watch out Look out- look out Watch out- watch out Look out- look out Watch out- watch out Look out- look out Watch out- watch out Look out- look out Chorus Girls you know you'd better- watch out (Watch out!)

Much of his work was produced by Allen Toussaint with instrumental backing provided by the Meters.  Born Irving Lee Dorsey in New Orleans- Louisiana- Dorsey moved to Portland- Oregon when he was ten years old. He served in the United States Navy and began a career in prizefighting. Boxing as a light heavyweight in Portland in the early 1950s- he fought under the name ""Kid Chocolate"" and was quite successful.  Dorsey met songwriter/producer Allen Toussaint at a party in the early 1960s- and was signed to the Fury record label. The song that launched his career was inspired by a group of children chanting nursery rhymes - ""Ya Ya"" went to number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961. It sold over one million copies- and was awarded a gold disc. He recorded other songs for Fury before the label folded- and Dorsey went back to his car repair business.  Toussaint later came back on the Amy label and began to work with Dorsey once again. From 1965 to 1969 Dorsey put seven songs in the Hot 100- the most successful of which was ""Working in the Coal Mine"" in 1966. It was to be his second and last Top Ten song. In 1970 Dorsey and Toussaint collaborated on an album entitled Yes We Can; the title song was Dorsey's last entry in the singles chart. It was later a hit for the Pointer Sisters under the title- ""Yes We Can Can"".  Dorsey appeared on an album with Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes- which led to more recordings on his own with ABC Records in the late 1970s. In 1980- Dorsey opened for English punk band The Clash on their U.S. tour.  Dorsey contracted emphysema and died in New Orleans in 1986- at the age of 61.

Leonard Cohen performs Take This Waltz- his song based on his own translation of Garcia Lorca's Peque_o vals vien_s.    The Leonard Cohen Files says: ""The video was filmed in Spain- in the city of Granada- famous for the Alhambra Castle. Leonard Cohen is shown in the house of Federico Garcia Lorca. 6 min- color.""    Note: This is 1986 version of the song- produced for the Spanish tribute album ""Poets In New York"". Later- Cohen released the same track on his 1988 album I'm Your Man- adding Raffi Hakopian's violin and Jennifer Warnes' vocals in overlayers. So don't be alarmed if you don't hear Warnes' duetting on some verses and no violin at all.    According to some sources- this wasn't real video clip- but promotional clip which originally was the part of TV programme accompanying ""Poets in New York"" LP. Strangely enough- there's another version at YouTube- recorded from TV Espana- two minutes longer- re-edited and re-cut - some extra shots show Cohen playing the piano- walking through Garcia Lorca's house museum etc. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV97_RUbuso My version is 4 minutes- while The Leonard Cohen Files says it should be six minutes. Nevertheless- my version is obviously also complete clip- and I took it from the home-made DVDR which was shown on Leonard Cohen Event organised by The LC Files- while the DVDR's contents came from press kit tapes sent by Mr. Cohen- so...",302,3096,53,834835,nullLeonard Cohen,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIssqxixYp0,tIssqxixYp0,Leonard Cohen Live: Suzanne (Rare Footage),Rare Footage of Leonard Cohen discussing and playing Suzanne,160,1349,14,212085,nullLes Humphries Singers,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR5MHHGhyBA,hR5MHHGhyBA,Les Humphries Singers - Mama Loo (Disco 1973),Les Humphries Singers,426,1871,51,1565435,nullLes Humphries Singers,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OZvR8AoiCY,1OZvR8AoiCY,Les Humphries Singers - Take care of me (live in Germany- 1972),Les Humphries Singers - Take care of me (live in Germany- 1972),2,13,0,3315,nullLesley Gore,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDUjeR01wnU,JDUjeR01wnU,Lesley Gore - You Don't Own Me (HD),"Lesley Gore performs ""You Don't Own Me"" on the 1964 T.A.M.I show.",461,3750,52,539843,nullLesley Gore,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbOrjHBaDzQ,bbOrjHBaDzQ,Lesley Gore - It's my party live 1964,Lesley Gore - It's my party (1964)  Oh- It's my party- and I'll cry if I want to Cry if I want to- cry if I want to You would cry too if it happened to you  Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone Judy left the same time Why was he holding her hand When he's supposed to be mine  It's my party- and I'll cry if I want to Cry if I want to- cry if I want to You would cry too if it happened to you  Playin' my records- keep dancin' all night Leave me alone for a while 'Till Johnny's dancin' with me I've got no reason to smile  It's my party- and I'll cry if I want to Cry if I want to- cry if I want to You would cry too if it happened to you  Judy and Johnny just walked through the door Like a queen with her king Oh what a birthday surprise Judy's wearing his ring  It's my party- and I'll cry if I want to Cry if I want to- cry if I want to You would cry too if it happened to you,31,402,18,78369,nullThe Lettermen,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad8t4PVu7Hg,ad8t4PVu7Hg,"The Lettermen ""Love Is A Many Splendored Thing""",The Lettermen- Tony Butala- Mark Preston and Donovan Tea- sing this wonderful love song at a recent performance in New York.

Although Minaj has been less aggressive with her response- it doesn't look like these two will become friendly anytime soon. ""I saw her coming in the game like- 'All you chicks that's been in the game for 10 years- move over-"" Kim explained in an interview with Hot 97's Angie Martinez. ""I thought that was disrespectful. Then she started saying stuff that was almost direct[ly] towards me ... and you could tell.""    Minaj's fondness for colorful wigs and female presence in an all male rap crew- has long been compared to Kim. Yet since dropping her platinum selling debut 'Pink Friday' last November- the 26-year-old is slowly but surely etching out her own lane in hip-hop history. ""She just really jumped out the window and you got to be careful when you pick fights-"" Minaj told Martinez of Kim. ""I think people get me mistaken with a real Barbie. They forget where I'm from and if I have to revert back- I can and I will. It's one of those moments where you say- 'Don't play with me-' because I respect you- I love you- I've said it in every interview time and time again- and if that's not good enough with you mama- then it's something deep rooted in you-"" she reveals. ""Something is bothering you inside. That's your insecurity bothering you. [If] it's not Nicki Minaj- it would have been any girl that started poppin'. She picked a fight with Foxy [Brown]- then she picked a fight with Eve- then she picked a fight with Remy [Ma]- then it was Ms. [Voletta] Wallace- then it was Nicki Minaj.""    Alongside the mixtape- Kim is also said to be working on a full-fledged album release.     -FAIR USE-  ""Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976- allowance is made for ""fair use"" for purposes such as criticism- comment- news reporting- teaching- scholarship- and research.

(Ozzy) Heaven- is in the palm of my hand- and it's waiting here for you What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy?  CHORUS: (Ozzy) If I close my eyes forever Will it all remain unchanged? If I close my eyes forever Will it all remain the same?  (Ozzy) Sometimes it's hard to hold on- so hard to hold on to my dreams. It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me.

""Lloyd Price is widely known as ""Mr. Personality-"" a nickname copped from one his best-known songs- ""Personality-"" from 1959. Among the premier rhythm & blues singers of the Fifties and Sixties- the Louisiana native can also claim a host of other talents: musician- bandleader- songwriter- producer- record-company executive and booking agent. In his prime he recorded for the Specialty and ABC-Paramount labels. The bulk of his R&B sides were cut for Specialty and bear the hallmark of the New Orleans sound. His biggest R&B hit- ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy-"" was an original song produced by Dave Bartholomew and featuring Fats Domino on piano. Based on a commercial jingle he'd written- ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"" topped the R&B charts for seven weeks in 1952. It was also widely covered- both in the Fifties and beyond- by the likes of Elvis Presley (who performed it on his 1968 NBC-TV special)- the Buckinghams- John Lennon and Elvis Costello. ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"" is a rhythm & blues classic that helped give birth to rock and roll.  Price recorded more hits during his early-Fifties tenure at Specialty- but his career was interrupted by the Korean War. Upon returning from three years of service- he launched KRC (Kent Record Company) with Harold Logan- a longtime friend and collaborator. A shrewd businessman- Price leased his recordings to ABC-Paramount- thereby retaining control of his music while receiving national distribution. His most renowned recording came with ""Stagger Lee-"" an R&B remake of the folk-blues standard ""Stack-o-Lee"" that topped the pop and R&B charts. Recorded versions of the song date back to the Twenties- but Price's ""takes the prize-"" according to Greil Marcus in a detailed analysis of the song's roots and evolution. ""Price's record was hard rock- driven by a wailing sax- and in retrospect his manic enthusiasm seems to be what many earlier versions lacked-"" wrote Marcus.  Price's biggest year was 1959- during which he released four hits: ""Personality-"" ""Where Were You (On Our Wedding Day)-"" ""I'm Gonna Get Married"" and ""Come Into My Heart."" His entrepreneurial skill led to the helming of more labels (Double-L and Turntable)- as well as a New York City nightclub (Lloyd Price's Turntable). Double-L launched the recording career ofWilson Pickett in 1963. Price continued to place his own recordings on the R&B charts into the Seventies. Meanwhile- he performed around the country with a nine-piece band while keeping a resourceful hand in various other entrepreneurial pursuits and ventures.""

""What a Wonderful World"" is a song written by Bob Thiele (as ""George Douglas"") and George David Weiss. It was first recorded by Louis Armstrong and released as a single in 1967. Thiele and Weiss were both prominent in the music world (Thiele as a producer and Weiss as a composer/performer). Armstrong's recording was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. The publishing for this song is controlled by Memory Lane Music Group- Carlin Music Corp.- and Bug Music- Inc.  Intended as an antidote for the increasingly racially and politically charged climate of everyday life in the United States- the song also has a hopeful- optimistic tone with regard to the future- with reference to babies being born into the world and having much to look forward to. The song was initially offered to Tony Bennett- who turned it down. Thereafter- it was offered to Louis Armstrong. George Weiss recounts in the book Off the Record: Songwriters on Songwriting by Graham Nash that he wrote the song specifically for Louis Armstrong. George was inspired by Louis's ability to bring people of different colorus together. The song was not initially a hit in the United States- where it sold fewer than 1-000 copies because the ABC Records head Larry Newton did not like the song and therefore did not promote it- but was a major success in the United Kingdom- reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart. In the US- the song hit #116 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Chart. It was also the biggest-selling single of 1968 in the UK where it was among the last pop singles issued by HMV Records before becoming an exclusive classical music label. The song made Louis Armstrong the oldest male to top the UK Singles Chart- at sixty-six years and ten months old. Armstrong's record was broken in 2009 when a cover version of ""Islands in the Stream"" recorded for Comic Relief -- which included the 68-year-old Tom Jones -- reached number one in that chart. Tony Bennett did go on to cover ""What A Wonderful World"" several times- as in 2003 with K.D. Lang- paying homage to Bennett's friend Armstrong.  ABC Records' European distributor EMI forced ABC to issue a What A Wonderful World album in 1968 (catalogue number ABCS-650) which did not chart in the US due to ABC's non-promotion of it- but did chart in the UK where it was issued by Stateside Records with catalogue number SSL 10247 and peaked on the British chart at No. 37.  The song gradually became something of a standard and reached a new level of popularity. In 1978- Armstrong's 1967 recording was featured in the closing scenes of the first series of BBC radio's cult hit- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy- and was repeated for BBC's 1981 TV series of the same. In 1988- Armstrong's recording was featured in the film Good Morning- Vietnam and was re-released as a single- hitting #32 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in February 1988. The single charted at number one for the fortnight ending June 27- 1988 on the Australian chart.  The song was also used in the first five episodes of the ABC sitcom Family Matters- before being replaced by an original theme song- ""As Days Go By""- sung by Jesse Frederick.  In 2001- rappers Ghostface Killah- Raekwon and The Alchemist released ""The Forest-"" a song which begins with three lines of lyric adapted from ""What a Wonderful World""- altered to become ""an invitation to get high"" on marijuana. The rappers and their record company- Sony Music Entertainment- were sued by the owners of ""What a Wonderful World-"" Abilene Music. The suit was thrown out of court after judge Gerard E. Lynch determined that the altered lyric was indisputably a parody- transforming the uplifting original message to a new one with a darker nature.  As of April 2014- Louis Armstrong's 1967 recording has sold 2-713-000 downloads in the US after it was released digitally.",125,501,7,80191,nullLouis Armstrong,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UGFXB7ytY4,9UGFXB7ytY4,Louis Armstrong & His All-Stars (Live @ The Newport Jazz Festival 1958),"Louis Armstrong performs Up A Lazy River- Old Rockin' Chair (duet with trombonist/singer Jack Teagarden)- & When The Saints Go Marching In.  Louis Armstrong (August 4- 1901 -- July 6- 1971)- nicknamed Satchmo or Pops- was an American jazz trumpeter and singer from New Orleans- Louisiana. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an ""inventive"" trumpet and cornet player- Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz- shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice- Armstrong was also an influential singer- demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser- bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also skilled at scat singing (vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics).  Renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing- Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music- and by the end of his career in the 1960s- he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to ""cross over""- whose skin color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race- often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans- but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation during the Little Rock Crisis. His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a black man.  Jazz on a Summer's Day (1960) is a documentary film set at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island- co-filmed and co-directed by commercial and fashion photographer Bert Stern and director Aram Avakian- who also edited the movie. It was written by Albert D'Annibale and Arnold Perl. The Columbia Records jazz producer- George Avakian- was the musical director of the film.  The film mixes images of water and the city with the performers and audience at the festival. It also features scenes of the 1958 America's Cup yacht races. The film is largely without dialog or narration (except for periodic announcements by emcee Willis Conover).  The film features performances by Jimmy Giuffre- Thelonious Monk- Sonny Stitt- Anita O'Day- Dinah Washington- Gerry Mulligan- Chuck Berry- Louis Armstrong- and Jack Teagarden. Also appearing are Buck Clayton- Jo Jones- Armando Peraza- and Eli's Chosen Six- the Yale College student ensemble that included trombonist Roswell Rudd- shown driving around Newport in a convertible jalopy- playing Dixieland.  Many performances ran so long that the last act- Mahalia Jackson- did not appear on stage until after midnight- performing The Lord's Prayer.  In 1999- the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally- historically- or aesthetically significant"".",33,150,2,33066,nullLouis Neefs,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHy3QOMtgms,iHy3QOMtgms,Louis Neefs - Zondagmiddag Lilian,"De onvergetelijke warme stem van Louis Neefs.

It features vocal contributions from R&B singer Michael Marshall. The song has become their most famous to date- and helped make Operation Stackola their best-selling album. ""I got 5 on it"" is a phrase meaning to pay half for a dime bag (a 10-dollar bag of marijuana) with another person. The lyrics in the original song clearly convey this meaning. ""Kinda broke so ya know all I gots five- I got five"" ""Unless you pull out the fat- crispy five dollar bill on the real before its history"" ""I got 5 on it- let's go half on a sack"" The remix to the song- which can be found on the CD single known as the ""Bay Ballas Remix""- featured an extensive list of artists from the Bay Area including original collaborator Michael Marshall on the chorus- Dru Down- E-40- Richie Rich- Shock G- and Spice 1. Later remixes attempt to modify the original meaning. In Dru Down's verse he states the ""5"" can refer to either $500 or a Mercedes-Benz 500E for the particularly wealthy- while Numskull suggests the practice can also be used to assist in paying for alcoholic beverages such as Hennessy- Seagrams or 40's. The song samples Club Nouveau's ""Why You Treat Me So Bad"" (1987)- Kool and the Gang's ""Jungle Boogie"" (1973) and Audio Two's ""Top Billin'"" (1987). There have also been several unofficial 'Drum 'n' Bass' remixes of this track. In 2000- Yukmouth appeared on a ""sequel"" titled ""G'z On It"" with Mac Mall and Fed-X on Killa Tay's album Snake Eyes In 2011- also a Dutch rapper named Hef used this instrumental beat for his freestyle on a radio called 101 Barz The single reached #2 in Germany- #3 in the United Kingdom and #8 in the United States. The single was certified platinum by the RIAA on October 31- 1995 for shipping of one million copies. Hailing from the San Francisco bay area- the song is still very popular in that region. Adding to this popularity is the fact that the popular morning radio show- ""The Rise Guys"" (featuring Whitey Gleason- Mark Kreidler & Dan Dibley with Dave ""Deuce"" Mason as producer) on KGMZ 95.7FM The Game- has a recurring segment on Fridays called ""The Friday Five"" that uses ""I Got 5 on It"" as the theme song. The song plays on a loop in the back ground- featuring prominently the words- ""I Got 5 on It."" As part of ""The Friday Five"" there is a main sports topic driving each individual list. Then each host takes a turn doing one of the lists (starting with five options- then four- then three and so on down to one). Each list is usually littered with sports and pop culture references. Hilarity usually ensues. The instrumentals for ""I Got 5 on It"" are used for the song ""Satisfy You"" by Puff Daddy featuring R. Kelly- Luniz is featured in the official West Coast Remix of the song. The song has also been freestyled by many notable rappers such as: Lloyd Banks- Lil' Flip- Potluck and many others. Turkish rapper Emre Baransel used the instrumental on the song ""Ver 5'i"" (Classical Mixtape) which features Sahtiyan and Turkish rap star Ceza. The remix of this song was covered by Twiztid on their Man's Myth (Vol. 1) album. This version was titled ""Bonus Flavor"" and also featured Insane Clown Posse- Blaze Ya Dead Homie- Anybody Killa- Esham and Lavel. The instrumental was sampled for the official remix of R&B singer J. Holiday's single- ""Bed""- that features rappers Trina and Ja Rule. The instrumental was also sampled by Jennifer Lopez for her record ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" featuring Nas. Big Sean also used the beat for his version of the song called ""5 Bucks (5 on It)"" featuring Chip tha Ripper and Curren$y on his mixtape ""Finally Famous Volume 3: BIG"".",230,2965,41,540053,nullLuniz,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p78BeRJZzkk,p78BeRJZzkk,LIVE CONCERT -  Alkaholiks- Luniz- Xzibit- Daz Dillinger- Mack10- Slick Rick,"One of LA's biggest concerts ""Unity Fest 2000""!

Mac Davis wrote this song with Doc Severinsen.""Severinsen was best known as the bandleader on the NBC late-night talk show The Tonight Show. Davis was an occasional guest on the show- and during this time the two became acquainted. Following an appearance on the show- Severinsen approached Davis with the idea of recording a song that included the phrase ""stop and smell the roses""- since he had recently heard the phrase from a physician. Soon after- Davis vacationed in Hawaii and wrote the song- crediting Severinsen as a co-writer for giving him the idea. Severinsen was quoted as saying that Davis ""could have gone ahead and written the song and not done that.""  The lyrics to the song advise that while it is often necessary to forsake family obligations and pleasurable activities in order to succeed professionally- everyone should make sure that they take some time to ""stop and smell the roses along the way""(WIKIPEDIA) LYRICS:  (Davis/Severinsen) Hey Mister Where you going in such a hurry Don't you think it's time you realized There's a whole lot more to life than work and worry The sweetest things in life are free And there right before your eyes You got to Stop and Smell the roses You've got to count your many blessings everyday You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road If you don't Stop and Smell the roses along the way Before you went to work this morning in the city Did you spent some time with your family Did you kiss your wife and tell her that she's pretty Did you take your children to your breast and love them tenderly You got to Stop and Smell the roses You've got to count your many blessings everyday You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road If you don't Stop and Smell the roses along the way Did you ever take a walk through the forest Stop and dream a while among the trees Well you can look up through the leaves right straight to heaven You can almost hear the voice of God In each any every breeze You got to Stop and Smell the Roses You've got to count your many blessings everyday You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road If you don't Stop and Smell the Roses along the way You got to Stop and Smell the roses You've got to count your many blessings everyday You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road If you don't Stop and Smell the roses along the way",23,89,0,12483,nullMac Davis,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCyYuLQ7_Ws,RCyYuLQ7_Ws,Kenny Rogers & Mac Davis - Hard To Be Humble LIVE,Mac Davis singing his song 'Hard to be a Humble' live during a Kenny Rogers concert in the 80's.,48,1065,32,187859,nullMacklemore and Ryan Lewis,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zNSgSzhBfM,2zNSgSzhBfM,MACKLEMORE & RYAN LEWIS - CAN'T HOLD US FEAT.

Note from Ryan Lewis:  It seems like when a music video comes out- the title that receives all of the credit and travels with a film is that of the director. It's as though the director is the ""artist"" or ""creator"" of the music video- when in reality a music video is first a written treatment- produced (putting together ingredients like actors and locations)- shot and directed- cut on the editing board and finally color graded. The music might be fine tuned and scored specifically for that film. There are so many variables that are completely equal if not sometimes more complicated than directing- it's a shame that so much credit comes down to whoever fulfills that position. A director wouldn't have shit to direct without a producer. A producer would have nothing to produce without a writer- and so forth.   For our team- I think it's even more complicated because roles tend to cross over. We simply don't work within the conventional hierarchy of the film industry (director- producer- etc.) Sure- people have concrete pre-defined roles based on their expertise- but our team has the remarkable ability to wear multiple hats. Can't Hold Us was a video that showcased this well.   After three months of shooting- finally getting to those last few frames where you reveal the credits- it's a tense moment. There isn't exactly a sensible way to do it- if we're trying to fit people into classic film roles. It leads me to the point that although we do our best to give people titles- this was a video fully created by seven individuals at the forefront. Take any of those people out of the equation- you'd be watching a very different video. I write this in hopes that you don't fall under the illusion that one person creates a music video- particularly at the Macklemore camp. We are constantly challenging and enhancing each others ideas and I take pride in believing that's the reason we make great videos. - Ryan Lewis  Music Video:  Written By Ben Haggerty Ryan Lewis Tricia Davis  Directed By Ryan Lewis Jason Koenig Jon Jon Augustavo  Produced By Tricia Davis Honna Kimmerer Jenny Koenig  Starring Ben Haggerty Ryan Lewis Ray Dalton Owuor Arunga Da Kadu Brown  Director of Photography Jason Koenig Ryan Lewis Mego Lin  Stedicam Operators Chris Duerkopp Rhys Duncan Ant Ireland Alex Kornreich  Production Assistants Linda SImonsen Jackie Ganger Edward Tran Adam Leeman Nic Adenau Johnny Valencia Ben Campofreda Seth McDonald Mitchell Overton Lei Tao  Editing & Color Grading Ryan Lewis Jason Koenig  Post Production Supervisor Erik Hustad  Special Thanks RED Panavision Victory Studios Koerner Camera Space Needle Ryan Sanson Lady Washington Logan Neitzel Sierra Blu Kennels USC FIJI House Niche Camera Karen Stimwell & Co.

Music by Harold Arlen- with lyrics by Johnny Mercer- published in 1944. It is sung in the style of a sermon- and explains that accentuating the positive is key to happiness.(Wikipedia). Among many of Johnny Mathis' songs- in addition to beautiful- romantic and often soulful ballads- is a body of uplifting work- songs that focus on the good things in life- living to the fullest- and fanciful numbers engaging the child in us (Toyland- When You Wish Upon a Star- to name a few). Particularly in times that challenge- music like this brings out the basics -what's important in life - reminding us that we always have choice.

[chorus]  And then a hero comes along-  With the strenght to carry on-  And you cast your fears aside and you know you can survive-  So when you feel like hope is gone-  Look inside you and be strong-  And you'll finally see the truth that a hero lies in you.    It's a long road-  When you face the world alone-  No one reaches out a hand for you to hold-  You can find love-  If you search within yourself-  And the emptiness you felt will disappear.    [chorus]    Lord knows-  Dreams are hard to follow-  But don't let anyone tear them away-  Hold on-  There will be tomorrow-  In time you'll find the way.

The movie is owned by Warner Brothers and I make no claim to owning it. Apparently it is also claimed by EMI too. Again I do not claim that this is mine- do not make any kind of profits from sharing this wonderful song with everyone- there is no copyright infringing- if anything this video is shown for Warner Brothers to get sales of their movie- which only they will profit from- not me.  **ATTENTION VIEWERS: For those who watch this and comment- for which I thank each and every one of you who do it means a lot that you people enjoy it because that was the point of putting this video up. However- to those who can't seem to say nice things- singing opera is not a competition. Pavarotti- Jussi Bjorling and Mario Lanza did not all sing this song to compete. It is not a crime to enjoy all 3 of the singers. Please do not complain that you don't like it because ""Pavarotti is better"" or something. I love Pavarotti's La Donna e Mobile- I love Jussi's Pearl Fishers Duet- I love Mario Lanza's Chi Mi Frena In Tal Momento... All three are amazing singers. You can like all of them. Please do not compare and complain. Thank you.  Mario Lanza sings Nessun Dorma in the 1956 Classic- Serenade. Enjoy.  I didn't make this video though- I found it and decided to spread the joy of his amazing voice to those who have not heard it. Also I wanted this to be on the video response of the Ultimate Nessun Dorma video since Mario Lanza was- unfortunately- not included in that video. Therefore I wanted to ""add"" him by doing a video response for all to see this. So yeah. Like I said- enjoy it.  Thank you all for bringing this video over the 1 million view mark!

He is known for wearing Native American-themed outfits on stage and is 25 percent Cherokee. Height of his career (late 1950s)  Rainwater was one of country's most noteworthy stars in the late 1950s- when his good looks and baritone voice made him popular. One of the first country songs he recorded was ""Gonna Find Me a Bluebird""- which he wrote. Released in 1957- the song became a big country-pop crossover hit- making Rainwater among the first country singers to appeal to a pop market. The song reached No. 5 on the country chart and 18 on the pop chart. It sold one million copies by 1957- and gave Rainwater his first gold record. During the song's success- Rainwater relocated to the New Jersey-New York area.  ""The Majesty of Love"" (1957) was a duet with Connie Francis- which also sold over one million copies. His next single- ""So You Think You Got Troubles""- was a successful follow-up on the country charts- but not on the pop charts. His self-penned ""Whole Lotta Woman"" reached UK No. 1 one for three weeks in April and May 1958. A second UK single- ""I Dig You Baby""- made No. 19 in June 1958. Another hit was ""Nothin' Needs Nothin' (Like I Need You)"".  Rainwater performed and toured throughout the rest of the 1950s. In 1959- he added three more gold records: ""My Love Is Real""- ""My Brand Of Blues"" and ""Half Breed"" all sold in excess of one million records. ""Half Breed"" was a cover version of a John D. Loudermilk song- and in 1959- Rainwater recorded another Loudermilk song- ""The Pale Faced Indian"". His original version went unnoticed- but later efforts by Don Fardon and Paul Revere & The Raiders under the title ""Indian Reservation"" were hits.  His voice began to give out- and he developed calluses on his vocal cords. As a result- Rainwater and MGM Records parted ways in 1960. He went into brief retirement to rest his voice and then recorded sporadically for Warwick Records (United Kingdom)- although without any hits. In the 1960s- he recorded for a series of record labels including United Artists- Warner Bros. and Sonet; and started his own record company called Brave Records",40,253,6,36052,nullMarvin Rainwater,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKwth6P68g4,aKwth6P68g4,MARVIN RAINWATER so you think you've got troubles LIVE,MARVIN RAINWATER so you think you've got troubles LIVE HILLBILLY ROCKABILLY,2,12,0,1552,nullMary Hopkin,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKgu8etXXcQ,mKgu8etXXcQ,Mary Hopkin Goodbye,The Fully restored and remastered Video.

She came to the attention of Berry Gordy as a 17-year-old- hawking a song she'd written for Jackie Wilson; that song- ""Bye Bye Baby-"" became her first Motown hit in 1961. The full-throated approach of that single was quickly toned down in favor of a pop-soul sound. Few other soul singers managed to be as shy and sexy at the same time as Wells (Barbara Lewis is the only other that springs to mind)- and the soft-voiced singer found a perfect match with the emerging Motown production team- especially Smokey Robinson. Robinson wrote and produced her biggest Motown hits; ""Two Lovers-"" ""You Beat Me to the Punch-"" and ""The One Who Really Loves You"" all made the Top Ten in the early '60s- and ""My Guy"" hit the number one spot in mid-1964- at the very height of Beatlemania.   Mary turned 21 years old as ""My Guy"" was rising to the top of the charts- and left Motown almost immediately afterward for a reported advance of several hundred thousand dollars from 20th Century Fox. The circumstances remain cloudy years later- but Wells and her husband-manager felt Motown wasn't coming through with enough money for their new superstar; she was also lured by the prospect of movie roles through 20th Century Fox (which never materialized). It's been rumored that Wells was being groomed for the sort of plans that were subsequently lavished upon Diana Ross; more nefariously- it's also been rumored that Motown quietly discouraged radio stations from playing Wells' subsequent releases. What is certain is that Wells never remotely approached the success of her Motown years- entering the pop Top 40 only once (although she had some R&B hits). Motown- for their part- took care throughout the rest of the '60s not to lose their big stars to larger labels.   Wells' departure from Motown was so dramatic and unsuccessful that it has tended to overshadow the quality of her later work- which has almost always been dismissed as trivial by critics. True- it didn't match the quality of her Motown recordings -- Smokey Robinson could not be replaced. But her '60s singles for 20th Century Fox (whom she ended up leaving after only a year)- Atco- and Jubilee were solid pop-soul on which her vocal talents remained undiminished. She wrote and produced a lot of her late-'60s and early-'70s sessions with her second husband- guitarist Cecil Womack (brother of Bobby)- and these found her exploring a somewhat earthier groove than her more widely known pop efforts. She had trouble landing recording deals in the '70s and '80s- and succumbed to throat cancer in 1992.   ~ Richie Unterberger- All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Carter recorded for Sam Cooke's SAR record label in the early 1960s. He had his first hit in 1962 at the age of nineteen with ""When a Boy Falls in Love""- which was co-written by Cooke.   By the time he reached his commercial peak with Imperial Records in the middle of the decade- he was specializing in pop ballads. His biggest success was the Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit- ""Hold Me- Thrill Me- Kiss Me-"" which reached #8- in 1965. It sold over one million copies- and was awarded a gold disc.[1] He had a couple of other Top 40 entries over the next year- ""Band of Gold"" and ""All of a Sudden My Heart Sings""- as well as a few other easy listening sellers.

Ivan was the leader of the group- writing the majority of the songs and providing the lead vocals; Stefan was the guitarist; and other members changed frequently throughout the course of the group's career. They independently released their debut EP- Folk of the '80s- in 1980; it was reissued the following year by Stiff in Britain. During 1982- the band consisted of Ivan- Stefan- another brother Colin Doroschuk (keyboards)- along with drummer Allan McCarthy; this is the lineup that recorded Men Without Hats' 1982 debut album- Rhythm of Youth. Taken from their debut- the single ""The Safety Dance"" became a major hit- peaking on the American charts at number three in 1983. Driven by an insistent three-chord synthesizer riff- the song was one of the biggest synth pop hits of the new wave era. The group wasn't able to exploit its success- however. Folk of the '80s (Part III) stalled at number 127 on the charts in America and made even less of an impact in other parts of the world. Thanks to the minor-hit title track- 1987's Pop Goes the World was a bigger success- yet it didn't recapture the audience their first album had gained. Released two years later- The Adventures of Women & Men Without Hate in the 21st Century failed to chart- as did its follow-up- 1991's Sideways. The two albums' lack of success effectively put an end to Men Without Hats' career.",242,1038,33,328968,nullMen Without Hats,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JsKlZaYNnM,6JsKlZaYNnM,Men Without Hats - Live Hats - 14.Safety Dancing,from Live Hats DVD,1589,3652,117,1091133,nullMeredith Brooks,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ivt_N2Zcts,_ivt_N2Zcts,Meredith Brooks - Bitch,Music video by Meredith Brooks performing Bitch.,1241,12320,337,1489342,nullMeredith Brooks,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQhkEg4Rp7U,nQhkEg4Rp7U,"Meredith Brooks - Nothing In Between ""B***t"" [Live] (Lilith Fair '97)","Meredith Brooks ""Nothing In Between (Bitch)"" [Live] (Lilith Fair '97)  Lilith Fair foi um concert tour e festival musical m_vel fundado pela cantora canadense Sarah McLachlan- onde figuraram proeminentemente cantoras e profissionais da m_sica do sexo feminino.",6,60,2,13710,nullMerrilee Rush,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mJfzv7YK0E,0mJfzv7YK0E,Merrilee Rush - Angel Of The Morning (stereo w/o vocal overdubs),I never much cared for this song... that is until I heard it in stereo without vocal harmonies and background singers.

"" When Robert Pilatus- 32- was found dead in his hotel room in Friedrichsdorf near Frankfurt in April (1998)- it was the end of a drawn out downward spiral- hastened by humiliation and drugs."" In addition to the term humiliation- the author also noted that ""Pilatus' fall from the top of the pop world was steeper than any that had ever occurred before."" ""A music industry intent on proving its legitimacy in the face of scandal virtually erased Milli Vanilli from its playlists and its history."" None of this corresponds to what really happened - neither the humiliation saga- nor the Milli Vanilli finale. Milli Vanilli were never removed from music history. The Grammy was returned- but that is the only true element of the report. And the scandal- which happened just as Farian had predicted- cost Farian neither fame nor money - with the exception of the 400-000 dollars he donated by way of compensation. The real Milli Vanilli catastrophe was neither commercial nor musical. It was Robert Pilatus's death from a drug overdose. But this- practically a suicide in instalments- was not provoked by drugs and humiliation- but rather through drugs alone- which- in the excessive way in which Pilatus took them- resulted in humiliations which Pilatus had brought upon himself - he turned a deaf ear to any help or advice he was offered. In lucid moments he himself took the blame for his fate. To reduce the fact of sales of over one hundred million albums into humiliation is as absurd as it is adventurous. Both Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan- signed up by Farian in 1987 in Munich- came into a lot- a whole lot- of money for the first time. But Pilatus turned it all into drugs. All attempts at rehabilitation- which devoured huge sums of money (which always came from Farian) for nothing Pilatus began to doubt himself. And one thing followed another. ..taken from frankfarian report (1999)  http://frankfarian.com  http://millivanilli-bio.narod.ru  http://musicline.de/de/artist/MILLI+VANILLI",439,2752,141,1385982,nullMilli Vanilli,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crRc9-43WaU,crRc9-43WaU,Milli Vanilli - Girl you know it's true ( 1990 live ) ( HD 1080 p ),,42,170,13,120932,nullMillie Small,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYj9J4UH8ck,ZYj9J4UH8ck,Millie Small - My Boy Lollipop (1964) HQ,Millie Show YLE TV studios- Helsinki- Finland- December 1964.,718,4779,63,1048284,nullMillie Small,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxNgVMcYNY,GgxNgVMcYNY,Millie Small-My Boy Lollipop (1973).flv,Proto-ska,468,1477,19,641203,nullMills Brothers,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_Knzwe15PY,Q_Knzwe15PY,The Mills Brothers - How'm I Doin'- Hey- Hey,"Young the Mills Brothers sing their hit ""How'm I Doin'- Hey- Hey"".

The idea was that the New Seekers would appeal to the same market as the original Seekers- but their music had rock as well as folk influences. They achieved worldwide success in the early 1970s.  The group was formed after the disbanding of the successful 1960s Australian band The Seekers. Keith Potger- a member of The Seekers- put together The New Seekers in 1969- featuring Laurie Heath- Chris Barrington- Marty Kristian- Eve Graham- and Sally Graham (no relation to Eve Graham). Potger himself also performed and recorded with the group. After one single release- the line-up was reworked in 1970 to Eve Graham- Lyn Paul- Marty Kristian- Peter Doyle- and Paul Layton. This line-up found instant success with their debut release- a cover of Melanie Safka's ""What Have They Done to My Song- Ma""- (titled in the US as ""Look What They've Done To My Song- Ma ) which became a top 20 hit in the US and a minor one in the UK.Over the next year- the group released a number of singles to little recognition- but it was in June 1971 that they released their breakthrough hit- ""Never Ending Song of Love"" (the first of many hit songs to be produced by David Mackay). The song became a big hit in the UK- reaching No.2 and was one of the biggest selling singles of the year. Towards the end of 1971- the group recorded an adaptation of the Coca-Cola jingle- ""I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke""- which had gained much interest. Reworked as ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing""- the song became a worldwide success. It made No.1 in the UK for four weeks and sold just under a million copies. Today it still stands as one of the 100 best-selling singles ever in the UK. In the US- the song was also a hit- reaching No.7. It became a No.1 hit in many other countries and is the most recognised song by the group.Late in 1971- the group were chosen to represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest. They entered with the song ""Beg- Steal or Borrow""- which was chosen by viewers of BBC1's ""It's Cliff Richard!"" show from six shortlisted songs performed by the group on a weekly basis. They went on to finish in second place at the Eurovision final in Edinburgh- where the group received the biggest cheer of the night from the partisan audience. The song was a No.2 hit in the UK and sold well in Europe. Around this time- they also charted highly with their most successful album- We'd Like to Teach the World to Sing- which reached No.2. Another top five hit came with the next single- ""Circles"" in mid 1972. At the end of the year- the group took part in the BBC's anniversary TV show Fifty Years Of Music.

Just a different shade of awful- that's all. Hopefully someday someone will locate the master tape. shyman99 1 month ago Since it was made so long ago- i doubt the actual video quality will get much better but yeah i'm with you on that- but unfortunately i couldn't do much with the video except make it 16:4 and edit the colours so that it didn't look like it'd been stained with a tea bag (like the other videos do) .. but it now looks like it's been through a video laundry and is clean again.

Check out the ""Powermix"" on iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/i-cant-wait-powermix/id366619556  Since it first appeared in 1986 during the heyday of MTV- people having been asking us about the video for ""I Can't Wait"". What is the meaning behind it all? Why is Valerie pulling a shark out of a coffee pot? Is the dog wearing sunglasses a part of the band?  John and I have always loved the video for I Can't Wait. Working on it with Jim Blashfield was one of the highlights of our pop music career. Jim lives in Portland with his wife Mellisa Marsland (who also produced the video)- and his daughter Hallie. We have gotten to be good friends with Jim and his family over the years. We even got to work with Jim recently on a multi media performance called Brain Chemistry For Lovers. Jim directed- edited the script- and created video for it. Over the years we've had a few discussions about the music business and assorted other music related topics- but because the video for ICW had always ""made sense"" on a non-literal level to us- John and I had never thought to ask Jim ""What was that all about?""  Enter Sloan de Forest- a woman who calls herself ""the Pauline Kael of classic MTV"". Sloan had a blog called ""Images of Heaven: Remembering The Lost Art of Music Video"". She had decided it was time to uncover the story behind the ""making of"" ICW. She emailed Jim. He responded and copied us on the email. The blog no longer exists- but Jim's response does. The whole thing wouldn't fit here- but here's how it begins...  The video came about because I was a filmmaker living in Portland and my producer Melissa Marsland and I had just finished our first video- And She Was and another for Joni Mitchell called Good Friends and our fellow Portlanders-- the Nu Shooz crew who had been having some big international dance hits-- asked us to do a video for them. I  explained that I wanted to improvise it. I didn't want to plan it at all.  I wanted the experience of just making it up from what was around when we got to the studio. The morning of the shoot- I loaded my kitchen table and chair and lamp into my car along with some biology slides and a coffee maker  and some kind of cigar box and headed over to the stage. I rummaged around among the props there and found some canvas and some walls from a commercial and some fake cactuses.  I went upstairs where the band and the crew were assembled-- we had a good and very professional crew- as you can tell from looking at the images-- and told them I would be back in 10 minutes with instructions about setting up for the first shot- about which I had no idea whatsoever.  I rummaged around in people's offices and borrowed a few other items which looked promising. I went upstairs and said we were doing a video that took place in the desert and set people about creating that. It seemed like we needed something in front of the green walls so the video editor went down the street and came back with a dumpster and rigged a way to make the lid go up and down with fishing line. I recalled that my friends who were on vacation had a great looking dog house for their dog Buster and some people went there and stole it. We called up a friend with an obedient dog who would stay when asked and he brought his pooch over. Somebody else got a bunch of tools out of the trunk of their car. Now- fully prepared- with the band members doing an admirable job of hiding their apprehension- we were all set to shoot the live action! Valerie was completely along for the ride with a great sense of playfulness as her song was absolutely misinterpreted....  (if you want to finish the story you can find the rest on our blog here: http://www.nushoozmusic.com/news/13-i-can-t-wait-the-video-what-is-it-all-about)  Reading Jim's account of how the video came together made us appreciate him even more than we already do. And what a blast to have his version of the making of! He's a master at using images to explore that theme park of the mind -- the unconscious -- and give us all a great time while doing it.  Thought I'd share it with you.   - Valerie  For more about Nu Shooz past and present- check out http://www.nushoozmusic.com/  To watch more Nu Shooz videos- visit our YouTube Channel here: http://www.youtube.com/nushoozmusic",132,951,7,99376,nullNu Shooz,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGBvuaPV5g0,kGBvuaPV5g0,I Can't Wait (Live 1986) - Nu Shooz,www.freestylemusicvideos.com,24,1206,13,369055,nullO-Town,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYOFXp38jBI,yYOFXp38jBI,Otown - Liquid Dreams,,223,806,49,428743,nullO-Town,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHwsrZ1RjZQ,vHwsrZ1RjZQ,O-town - All Or Nothing (Live from New York),"Ashley- Erik- Dan- Jacob & Trevor - Live in Concert!

You would not believe your eyes If ten million fireflies Lit up the world as I fell asleep 'Cause they'd fill the open air And leave tear drops everywhere You'd think me rude But I would just stand and stare  I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems  'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs From ten thousand lightning bugs As they tried to teach me how to dance A foxtrot above my head A sock hop beneath my bed The disco ball is just hanging by a thread (Thread- thread...)  I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)  Leave my door open just a crack (Please take me away from here) 'Cause I feel like such an insomniac (Please take me away from here) Why do I tire of counting sheep? (Please take me away from here) When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Ha-ha)  To ten million fireflies I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes I got misty eyes as they said farewell (Said farewell) But I'll know where several are If my dreams get real bizarre 'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar- jar- jar...)

Musical tastes in 1957 reflected Bing Crosby- Patti Page- and comfy Middle-America. There were no country crossover artists- R&B was on only a few radio stations- and nobody worked on Sunday. Mainstream artists smoothed the edges off African music (The Weavers and Wimoweh)- classical music was modified (by Arthur Fiedler- and by songs like ""Till The End of Time"") and yes- if it wasn't mellowed by The Platters- Ink Spots or Nat King Cole- a jazz or R&B song got covered by a Pat Boone...which was at least the start of getting people acclimated to pumpernickel or rye rather than white bread. The Beatles covered Little Richard too- also making his raw sound a little more commercial. Now? Well- not everybody wants Little Richard over Boone or the Beatles' versions- but at least we have them all to choose from. This isn't some idiot taking a record and putting a photo to it- it's Pat Boone from a 1957 TV broadcast. ;p",109,59,103,41363,nullPatience and Prudence,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4gQ6xwISRs,b4gQ6xwISRs,Patience And Prudence - Gonna Get Along Without Ya Now,"The sister duo Patience and Prudence reached the Top Ten in 1956 with a fluke hit- the ghostly ""Tonight You Belong to Me."" The daughters of a professional musician -- Mark McIntyre- who accompanied Frank Sinatra on piano during the mid-'40s -- Patience and Prudence McIntyre reportedly learned the song while at summer camp in 1955 (when they were nine and 12- respectively). Their father recognized it as a Billy Rose hit from several decades earlier- and was impressed enough to work up the arrangement as a demo intended for cabaret singer Lisa Kirk (wife of Robert Wells). McIntyre also recorded a version with Patience and Prudence's vocals- strictly for personal reasons- but gave a dub to studio friend Ross Bagdasarian- who passed the record on to Si Waronker of Liberty Records.  Waronker loved the song- so Patience and Prudence signed to Liberty and recut the song with overdubs to strengthen their ethereal vocals- then watched as the record soared to number four nationally (with several cover versions eventually coming along). After performing on Perry Como's television show- they chose for a follow-up single ""Gonna Get Along Without You Now"" (earlier a minor hit for Teresa Brewer)- which just missed the Top Ten later in 1956. The duo recorded several more singles -- including a pairing with fellow Liberty act Mike Clifford and several singles for the Chattahoochee label -- but never reached the charts again. They reunited for a 1978 performance on a Dick Clark feature- and earned a surprisingly long lease on life after their songs were used in a pair of films- 1999's Election (""Gonna Get Along Without You Now"") and 2001's Ghost World (""A Smile and a Ribbon"").   ~ John Bush- All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

The girls released a few other singles in the late '50s and made a brief return to recording in the mid-'60s- but they failed to achieve further commercial success.  Nonetheless- their music - for the most part arranged by their father Mark McIntyre- who had played piano for Sinatra in the '40s and worked as an arranger for numerous other major stars of the post-war period  - retains its beguiling sweetness and charm more than half a century after it was recorded.   Patience & Prudence never released an album- but the 'A' and 'B' sides of all their singles (plus a few early demos) were collected on a great 'Best Of' CD in 2005. It's still available and has won the girls - who will be 70 and 67 respectively as I write this - quite a bit of latter-day interest- if internet discussion and frequent airings of their songs in movies and commercials are anything to go by.  Detailed information about what happened to Patience & Prudence post-fame is scant- because they went on to live ordinary middle-class lives in California- had no desire for fame and quite reasonably wished to keep their business to themselves.   In fact- as Patience revealed in a rare interview given in 2005 to coincide with the release of the 'Best Of' CD- she and her sister had never wanted to be recording artists in the first place- to the extent that she refers to their recording career as 'the accident'. You can read that interview- conducted by Doug Bright- here: http://tinyurl.com/8zd8sll .   Thanks are due to Mr Bright for soliciting the interview which- succinct though it is- nonetheless represents the most in-depth source of information available about Patience & Prudence's lives before- during and after fame.   Standard biographical material also exists- the core of which is to be found in the 'Best Of' CD booklet- for which I believe Patience was also consulted. You may find snippets of info here and there around the web- but probably not anything that isn't already covered in the booklet.  During their initial period of fame Patience & Prudence made just one TV appearance; on The Perry Como Show on September 15th 1956. Here it is now- for your viewing pleasure.   They made one further TV appearance in 1978- in a 'Where Are They Now' slot on a Dick Clark Special. If you'd like to see that too- I've uploaded it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-4GLbKIZpY .  Patience recalled in 2005 that at the time of its recording she and her sister were somewhat bemused as to why they were doing the Como Show at all- telling their father on set that they knew they were just 'a passing thing'.   Patience & Prudence's parents had concerns about overexposing the girls to the harsh glare of the showbiz spotlight which is why- despite the million-selling success of the 'Tonight' 45- the singing siblings were limited to performing just this one TV spot.  I'd wanted to see this performance myself for a long time and I knew P & P fans would too- so I tracked it down and posted it. I hope you enjoy it.

The union of your spirits- here- has caused Him to remain  For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name  There is Love. There is Love.    Well a man shall leave his mother and a woman leave her home  And they shall travel on to where the two shall be as one.  As it was in the beginning is now and until the end  Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again.  And there is Love. There is Love.    Well then what's to be the reason for becoming man and wife?  Is it Love that brings you here or Love that brings you life?  Or if loving is the answer- then who's the giving for?  Do you believe in something that you've never seen before?  Oh there's Love- there is Love.    Oh the marriage of your spirits here has caused Him to remain  For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name  There is Love. Oh there's Love.,195,970,16,270205,nullPaul Stookey,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xHc5yQojAY,9xHc5yQojAY,The Wedding Song (There is Love) Paul Stookey Live 2011,"Live Evergreen State Fair I had to see them before they're all gone.    ""The Wedding Song (There Is Love)"" is a song written by Noel Paul Stookey of Peter- Paul and Mary in the fall of 1969 and first performed at the wedding of Peter Yarrow to Mary Beth McCarthy at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Willmar- Minnesota. The song was featured on Stookey's first solo album- Paul and...- in 1971- and was moderately successful as a single.     In an article for Guideposts magazine- Stookey wrote that the song came through him originally in the first person- Jesus speaking through him.    He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts   Rest assured this troubadour is acting on his part   The union of your spirits here has caused him to remain   For whenever two or more of you are gathered in his name   There is love   There is love     Well a man shall leave his mother and a woman leave her home   They shall travel on to where the two shall be as one   As it was in the beginning- is now until the end   Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again   And there's love   There is love     Well then what's to be reason for becoming man and wife   Is it love that brings you here- or love that gives you life     For if loving is the answer- then who's the giving for?

The song was Cetera's first hit single and was included on his 1986 album- Solitude/Solitaire.  The single peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart on August 2- 1986- remaining in that spot for two weeks. It also spent five weeks atop the U.S. adult contemporary chart.[1] The song achieved similar success in the UK- peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart- where it was the 26th best-selling single of 1986.  The version of the song as released as a single and on Cetera's album Solitude/Solitare is edited- missing the beginning eight-second section of the song's bridge (which is heard in the actual Karate Kid II film).  The song earned nominations in 1986 for an Academy Award for Best Song and a Golden Globe in the category of Best Original Song. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award in 1987 for ""Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Male Artist.""  It went on to win an ASCAP Award for ""Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures"" and a BMI Film & TV Award for ""Most Performed Song from a Film.""

I guarantee it will bring you down-  If you try and fool yourself.  Do you wanna make love-  Or do you just want to fool around?  You can take it seriously-  Or take it somewhere else.    Take all the freedom that a lover will allow-  If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now.  Where love goes- a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep-  Don't make a promise that you cannot keep.    Do you wanna make love-  Or do you just want to fool around?  I guarantee it will bring you down-  If you try and fool yourself.  Do you wanna make love-  Or do you just want to fool around?  You can take it seriously-  Or take it somewhere else.    If you wanna get close to me-  You could do it so easily.  Is it love that I see when I look in your eyes-  Or just another empty lie?    Do you wanna make love-  Or do you just want to fool around?  I guarantee it will bring you down-  If you try and fool yourself.  Well- do you wanna make love-  Or do you just want to fool around?  You can take it seriously-  Or take it somewhere else.,202,603,10,183974,nullPeter McCann,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doDaxLR7sY0,doDaxLR7sY0,Peter McCann Do You Wanna Make Love,Peter McCann talks about and sings his multimillion selling hit Do You Wanna Make Love.

The song was written by Snow- produced by Dino Airali- and first appeared on her 1974 self-titled debut album.  On American Top 40 in September 1980- Casey Kasem claimed that Phoebe Snow said that the song is about Jackson Browne.  This was later dispelled by Snow as a rumor that had arisen only because Browne was the first musician she had toured with after release of the song.  Released as a single in late 1974- ""Poetry Man"" became Snow's first charting hit- rising to number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in April 1975.  The previous month- the song reached number one on the Billboard easy listening (adult contemporary) chart- where it remained for one week.  The success of ""Poetry Man"" helped Snow achieve a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist in 1975- an award that was won that year by composer Marvin Hamlisch.  Phoebe Snow (born Phoebe Ann Laub; July 17- 1950 -- April 26- 2011) was an American singer- songwriter- and guitarist.  She was born in New York City- New York.  Snow was raised in a household where Delta blues- Broadway show tunes- Dixieland jazz- classical music- and folk music recordings were played around the clock.  Her father- Merrill Laub- an exterminator by trade- had an encyclopedic knowledge of American film and theater and was also an avid collector and restorer of antiques.  Her mother- Lili Laub- was a dance teacher who had performed with the Martha Graham group.  Snow grew up in Teaneck- New Jersey and graduated from Teaneck High School.  She subsequently attended Shimer College in Mount Carroll- Illinois- but did not graduate.  Even as a student- she carried her prized Martin 00018 acoustic guitar from club to club in Greenwich Village- playing and singing on amateur nights.  Her stage name is a fictional advertising character created in the early 1900s for the Delaware- Lackawanna and Western Railroad---Phoebe Snow was a young woman who appeared on boxcars.  Snow was briefly married to Phil Kearns- and in December 1975 she gave birth to a severely brain-injured daughter- Valerie Rose.  She resolved not to institutionalize her- and cared for her at home until Valerie died on March 18- 2007 at the age of 31.  Despite this- over the years Snow performed with numerous artists including Lou Rawls- Dave Grusin- Garland Jeffreys- Jewel- Donald Fagen- Paul Simon- Billy Joel- Queen- Jackson Browne- Dave Mason- Linda Ronstadt- Bonnie Raitt- Michael McDonald- Boz Scaggs- Cyndi Lauper- Roger Daltrey- Chaka Khan- CeCe Peniston- Take 6- Michael Bolton- Thelma Houston- Mavis Staples- and Laurie Anderson- among others.  She suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on January 19- 2010 and slipped into a coma- enduring bouts of blood clots- pneumonia- and congestive heart failure.  Snow died on April 26- 2011 at age 60 in Edison- New Jersey.

This was the best I could do with the smaller AVI I had available. A lot of detail was lost on the original conversion by whoever encoded it.  Group History (From Wikipedia)  The Poppy Family was a late 1960s and early 1970s Canadian pop music group- based in Vancouver- British Columbia.   Seventeen year old Susan Pesklevits met Terry Jacks in the middle 1960s while she was a regular performer on a national teen TV show called Music Hop as well as many other national TV shows. She later called Jacks to accompany her on rhythm guitar for one of her live performances and eventually- with the addition of Craig McCaw on lead guitar- Susan decided to dedicate all her time to the trio. Craig McCaw introduced Satwant Singh on tablas and they became the Poppy Family. The name was chosen when Susan- Terry and Craig were searching for a new name and came across it in the dictionary. Susan and Terry were married in 1967 and Susan Pesklevits became Susan Jacks.   With Susan Jacks on vocals and Terry Jacks on rhythm guitar- along with musicians Craig McCaw (guitar/sitar) and Satwant Singh (tablas/drums)- the group recorded their first album- from which came their best known song ""Which Way You Goin' Billy?"" (No. 1 in Canada and No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 charts) which was a worldwide hit. Their second and last album Poppy Seeds was recorded with studio musicians after Terry Jacks released Craig and Satwant from the group. Later hits included ""That's Where I Went Wrong"" (#9- also #27 US)- 'Where Evil Grows' (#6- also #45 US)- and `Good Friends?'(#10- also ""Bubbling Under"" the US chart). In the United States ""Which Way You Goin' Billy?"" and ""That's Where I Went Wrong"" were both Top 10 Adult Contemporary chart hits as well; ""Where Evil Grows"" and ""Good Friends?"" both also hit the US AC chart. The Poppy Family's first two Canadian releases were ""Beyond the Clouds"" (#75 in 1968)- ""What Can The Matter Be?"" (#53 in 1969). Other releases included ""I Was Wondering"" (#10 in 1971- also US #100) and ""No Good To Cry"" (#8 in 1972)- ""I'll See You There"" and ""Tryin'"".   At their career peak- Susan performed ""Which Way You Goin' Billy?"" on Bobby Darin's 1970 television variety special- The Darin Invasion. They also appeared on other variety shows including Rollin' On The River with Kenny Rogers and The George Kirby Special. Although Susan enjoyed performing live- Terry was not interested and their career ultimately suffered.   The ""Which Way You Goin' Billy?"" single earned the group two 1970 Gold Leaf (Juno) Awards as well as two Moffatt Awards in 1970. The Juno Award is Canada's equivalent of the Grammy Award. The single version of ""Which Way You Goin' Billy"" went on to sell a total of more than 3? million worldwide- and was awarded a gold disc.[1]   Terry Jacks decided to drop the Poppy Family name in early 1973 and Susan and Terry recorded two solo albums- Terry Jacks' Seasons in the Sun and Susan Jacks' I Thought of You Again. Susan left the marriage later that same year.  Lyrics:  Which Way You Goin'- Billy (T. Jacks / London Records- Inc)  Which way you goin'- Billy? Can I go too? Which way you goin'- Billy? Can I go with you?  I really love you- Billy- And all this time- I thought you loved me- Billy- And you were mine.  I'm gonna miss you- Billy- And though I'm trying- I'm hurtin' so bad- Billy- I can't help crying.  You are my whole- babe- My heart and my soul- babe.

It was included on the soundtrack to the film Hiding Out- which starred Jon Cryer and came out the same year; the song later appeared on Pretty Poison's debut album- Catch Me I'm Falling (1988).

Later that same year- the song charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 chart- peaking at number eight and remaining in the top forty for fourteen weeks.

The B-side contained a shorter ""Spanish Mix"" vocal. A re-recorded version of ""Nighttime"" became their second Hot 100 hit- climbing to number 36.    An interpolation of ""Catch Me (I'm Falling)"" was used on Joss Stone's song ""Proper Nice""- taken from her 2007 album Introducing Joss Stone.    This song is featured in the movie ""Kickin it Old Skool"".    In 2009- VH1 ranked ""Catch Me (I'm Falling)"" number 47 on its program 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s.

It marked Queen's first released collaboration with another recording artist, and is featured on their 1982 album Hot Space. The song reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart. It was also number 31 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s.Queen had been working on the song under the title ""Feel Like"" but were not yet satisfied with the result.The final version that became ""Under Pressure"" evolved from a jam session the band had with Bowie at his studio in Montreux, Switzerland, therefore it was credited as co-written by the five musicians.According to Queen bassist John Deacon (as quoted in a French magazine in 1984), however, the song's primary musical songwriter was Freddie Mercury _ though all contributed to the arrangement. The earlier, embryonic version of the song without Bowie ""Feel Like"" is widely available in bootleg form.In more recent interviews, Queen guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor have credited the bass riff to Deacon; Bowie also said on his website that the bassline was already written before he became involved. In any case, the September 2005 edition of online music magazine Stylus singled out the bassline as the best in popular music history.The first title found for this song was ""People on Streets"". It then became ""Under Pressure"".",2024,14008,495,3837813,nullQueen Latifah,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkGY5EzA-h4,YkGY5EzA-h4,Queen Latifah - Just Another Day,"From 1993 Album: ""Black Reign"".....

Ik hou van water en van adem-  ik hou van schamel en van duur.  Er is geen stuiver die ik spaarde-  ik leef gewoon van uur tot uur.    Laat me- laat me  Laat me m'n eigen gang maar gaan.

Newman also presents this dichotomy by incorporating the names of L.A.'s Century Boulevard, Victory Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, Imperial Highway and 6th Street into the lyrics of the song. Traversing any one of these roadways from end to end will reveal some of the wealthiest and some of the poorest areas of the city. In the video, after Newman says the name of each street, a crowd shouts ""We love it!""Notwithstanding the arguably satiric message of the song, Newman confessed an affection for Los Angeles: referencing more of the song's lyrics in a 2001 interview, he explained, ""There's some kind of ignorance L.A. has that I'm proud of.

The Fleetwoods revived it in 1964 managing to chart again at #32 on the Hot 100 and #12 Adult Contemporary- while Ben E. King edged slightly into the Hot 100 at #91 with another remake in 1966. The Happenings had mid-chart success (at #51 Hot 100) later in 1966/1967- while Paul Anka had a comeback hit with his version in 1969 (charting at #27 Hot 100 and #2 Adult Contemporary). Finally- the Tavares charted at #14 R&B with yet another remake in 1977.  Written by George Motola and John S. Marascalco.   B-side is ""Till Then"" which I've also posted- and which is also excellent.",178,753,7,230099,nullRay Peterson,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZgg2gDrI-Q,oZgg2gDrI-Q,Ray Peterson - The Wonder of You (Live),"Long before Elvis- Ray Peterson sang this great song.

After writing and rehearsing for 18 months with no real intentions of either performing or recording- the bandmembers were urged by several friends to pursue their music seriously. This encouragement led the guys to book themselves several local shows- much to the quick embracement of their hometown scene. As the buzz grew- the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus recorded their first EP and began relentlessly spreading their name around Florida. Despite a rapidly developing fan base- several subsequent label showcases amounted to nothing and various bandmembers either exited or were asked to leave the group. Undeterred- the band's remaining core -- vocalist Ronnie Winter and guitarist Duke Kitchens -- began to rebuild the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. Soon completing the quintet were guitarist/vocalist Elias Reidy- bassist Joey Westwood- and drummer Jon Wilkes; childhood friends Reidy and Westwood had also previously played together in a metal band called In Fate's Hands. A few months after the lineup was solidified- the guys inked a deal with Virgin. Entering the studio with David Bendeth (Hawthorne Heights- Breaking Benjamin) in 2005- the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus began crafting their full-length debut. The resulting Don't You Fake It appeared in July 2006- and part of that summer was spent on the Warped Tour; the album was certified gold by the year's end- propelled by the success of the Top 40 single ""Face Down."" The band also contributed a track to the video game soundtrack for Madden NFL 2007. The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus set to work on a follow-up album in 2007- taking a brief break in early 2008 to launch an acoustic tour of the eastern seaboard. Lonely Road was then released in February 2009- three months after the announcement that guitarist Reidy had exited the band's lineup. ~ Corey Apar- All Music Guide  --------------------------  Connect with Moshcam:   Facebook - http://moshc.am/MoshcamFacebook Twitter - http://moshc.am/MoshcamTwitter Official Website - http://moshcam.com   Google+ - http://moshc.am/MoshcamGooglePlus Instagram - http://moshc.am/MoshcamInstagram Tumblr - http://moshc.am/MoshcamTumblr   --------------------------  Download our FREE app:   http://moshc.am/MoshcamAppStore  http://moshc.am/MoshcamGooglePlay",48,203,30,61151,nullRedbone,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf5Ho3HbYMQ,kf5Ho3HbYMQ,Two Tone - Redbone (Official Lyrics Video),Two Tone - Redbone Official Lyric Video  Copyright © Selfmade Entertainment 2013.  -----   Follow me on:  www.facebook.com/twotonedxb www.twitter.com/twotonedxb www.instagram.com/twotonedxb www.youtube.com/Twotonedxbtv www.soundcloud.com/twotonedxb,27,2291,10,98742,nullRedbone,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvWOQSqM94c,yvWOQSqM94c,Redbone - Come And Get Your Love (Live Rock Concert) HQ,"Come and Get Your Love is a 1974 hit single by the Native American rock band Redbone. The song was written by band member Lolly Vegas and produced by Lolly and his brother Pat Vegas- who was also a band member. It was originally featured on Redbone's album- Wovoka; later the song appeared on many ""greatest hits"" albums released by the band- as well as on numerous compilation albums of the 1970s. The song peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in April 1974. It spent 18 weeks in the Top 40 and landed as the 4th most popular song on the Hot 100 for 1974. The single was certified gold by the RIAA on April 22- 1974- which indicates that it had sold over a million copies in the United States. The song is Redbone's highest charting single and one of two Top 40 hits by the band (an earlier recording- ""The Witch Queen of New Orleans""- peaked at number 21 in 1972). The song ""Come and Get Your Love"" also exists in a longer version- with an introductory slow part- plus a longer repeated coda- however- most radio stations rarely play it on the air.  In 1995- the German eurodance group Real McCoy released a cover version of the song- which peaked at number 19 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. This version also went to number 1 on the American dance chart in August 1995. This version of the song also samples 2 Unlimited's hit single No One.",153,867,23,167275,nullRednex,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOYZaiDZ7BM,mOYZaiDZ7BM,Rednex - Cotton Eye Joe (Official Music Video) [HD] - RednexMusic com,Rednex - Cotton Eye Joe (Official Music Video) [HD].

He released his first album- Son of Rock 'n' Roll- on EMI America in 1979. In the summer of 1980- his single ""Tired of Toein' the Line"" became a Top Ten hit in the United States. The song was also popular internationally. EMI America's financial problems interfered with promotion efforts for the follow-up singles (several of which became hits in other countries)- and Burnette's second album- Heart Stopper- was not successful.    In 1981- Burnette toured Europe with the final version of his late father's The Rock and Roll Trio. He also used the band on his next album- Get Hot or Go Home! on Enigma Records. It also sold poorly- and Enigma dropped Burnette and the Trio rather than release a follow-up.    Burnette worked with Rosie Flores and Dwight Twilley in the mid-1990s- and also contributed vocals and the original ""Trouble Is I'm in Love With You"" to Paul Burlison's 1997 Train Kept A-Rollin' . In 1996- Burnette released Tear It Up on Core Records- which went bankrupt almost immediately after its release.    Burnette continued to tour internationally- and wrote the European hit ""You Got Away With Love"" for Percy Sledge in 1997.    produced by Bill House",106,545,11,191653,nullRocky Burnette,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAt0sG7saTI,mAt0sG7saTI,"Solid Gold (1980) Season 1 - Rocky Burnette - ""Tired Of Toeing The Line""","Rocky Burnette - ""Tired Of Toeing The Line"" (I do not own the rights to this video- all rights reserved by Paramount)",16,77,2,21539,nullRod McKuen,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1EvRKV5Q00,t1EvRKV5Q00,My Friend The Sea  by Rod McKuen,"I don't believe a man can write about the sea and not include himself.

Wilson says it is his favorite record- stating in Q Magazine's 1001 Best songs Ever: ""This is a special one for me. What a great sound- the Wall of Sound. Boy- first heard this on the car radio and I had to pull off the road- I couldn't believe it. The choruses blew me away; the strings are the melody of love. It has the promise to make the world better.""  The Ronettes recorded ""Be My Baby"" in July 1963 at the Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles and was released in August 1963 at Philles Records.  By the fall of that year- it had become a top ten hit- peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Top 100. ""Our lives were turned upside down-"" Ronnie later recalled. ""All the things I'd ever dreamed about were finally coming true ""Be My Baby"" turned out to be a huge record for the Ronettes; radio stations constantly played the song throughout the fall of 1963. ""Be My Baby"" inspired a legion of Ronettes fans- including Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys- who wrote ""Don't Worry Baby"" as a tribute to the group. The song is also notable for being the first recording work done by Cher- who was one of the backing vocals  on the song. Cher- the girlfriend of Sonny Bono at the time (who was then working for Phil Spector) was asked to join the back-up singers when one of them didn't show up for the recording that day. "" 'Be My Baby' was the first record I ever sang on-"" Cher later wrote. ""...I went out and stood in front of this big speaker and sang 'be my- be my baby' with the Ronettes and all these other singers.""Ah huh huh""- and ""Be My Baby!-"" Cher became a permanent backup singer for songs recorded by the Ronettes- along with other songs Phil Spector produced for his label Philles Records.",672,6456,86,1398999,nullRonnie Dyson,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM857HMde_k,YM857HMde_k,FAMILIAR STRANGERS - Ronnie Dyson,"From his 1979 Columbia album ""If The Shoe Fits"".",38,206,4,70309,nullRonnie Dyson,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sewPLdurnW8,sewPLdurnW8,CLOSE TO YOU / RONNIE DYSON,"( I Like Being ) Close To You - Ronnie Dyson from album ""THE MORE YOU DO IT"" in 1976",28,134,8,39259,nullRonnie Milsap,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvxQ57BvAQQ,PvxQ57BvAQQ,Ronnie Milsap - Stranger In My House,Music video by Ronnie Milsap performing Stranger In My House.

""Tenderly"" has been recorded by many famous artists- but possibly the best-known version is by Rosemary Clooney. Her recorded version reached only #17 on the Billboard magazine pop charts in early 1952- but is more popular than the chart data would suggest- as is evidenced by the fact that Tenderly served as the theme song for Clooney's 1956-1957 TV variety show. It also became her signature song.    I consciously came to know of the song in the late 1970's while watching a Bing Crosby Special; Rosemary- a guest star on the show- sang it and it just took my breath away; I immediately realized that I had heard the song before- and it brought vivid memories of my childhood and my mother. It is because of this that I made this video - A way to pay tribute to this great artist- song and to the beautiful memory of my late mother.

""Our Love Is Here to Stay""  from the 1938 film ""The Goldwyn Follies""    It is said that the Gershwin brothers took less than an hour to compose ""A Foggy Day"".    ""I was a stranger in the city    Out of town were the people I knew    I had that feeling of self-pity    What to do? What to do? What to do?    The outlook was decidedly blue    But as I walked through the foggy streets alone    It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known    CHORUS  A foggy day in London Town    Had me low and had me down    I viewed the morning with alarm    The British Museum had lost its charm    How long- I wondered- could this thing last?

Though it was written for ""The Goldyn Follies"" (1938)- ""Our Love Is Here to Stay"" is probably best remembered from the 1951 film ""An American in Paris"".    ""It's very clear  Our love is here to stay ;  Not for a year   But ever and a day.    The radio and the telephone  And the movies that we know  May just be passing fancies-  And in time may go !

It was released in May 1999. ""Anyone"" is like its predecessor 'Wish I could fly' a ballad- with instruments including piano- saxophone and strings. ""Anyone"" was initially planned to be the first single from Have A Nice Day- but the group feared it would sound too ""Roxette-ish"" for a comeback single[citation needed]- and they chose ""Wish I Could Fly"" instead. After the success of ""Wish I Could Fly""- fans believed the next single release would be ""Stars"" or ""Crush On You""[citation needed] (both are dance songs a-typical for Roxette). But in the end- it was ""Anyone"" that was picked as the second single. The B-sides are the demo of ""Anyone""- ""Cooper"" (a track from Have A Nice Day)- and ""You Don't Understand Me (Abbey Road Sessions 1995)"". The maxi-single includes the video of ""Wish I Could Fly"". In Japan- a double A-side with ""Pay The Price"" was released- although there is no video for this song.  Chart Success ""Anyone"" is often regarded as a flop- because in Europe it never achieved as much success as its predecessor. It charted only in The Netherlands at #73- Germany (peaking outside the Top 50)- Sweden (where it failed to reach the Top 30)- and Switzerland- where it was a modest success- spending two weeks in the Top 30. EMI UK refused to release ""Anyone"" because of the poor chart results of the single in Europe. However- in South America- ""Anyone"" gained far more attention and the country's radio stations later even airplayed the Spanish version- ""Alguien"".  Music video The video of ""Anyone""- directed by Jonas Åkerlund- was banned by some TV stations (although it achieved videplay on MTV Europe) because of a scene in which Marie Fredriksson attempts suicide by drowning herself in the sea. The video was recorded in Portugal in the peninsula of Tr_ia. The clip was only broadcast after 10pm in many countries- because some believed it suggested young people to commit suicide",11,85,3,18775,nullRoxette,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT3ZFyfLZWw,qT3ZFyfLZWw,Roxette - It must have been love (live in Sydney 1991),Roxette live in Sydney in 1991.,351,2302,43,1474272,nullRoxy Music,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOnde5c7OG8,kOnde5c7OG8,Roxy Music - More Than This,Music video by Roxy Music performing More Than This.,2280,15318,345,3617170,nullRoxy Music,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEalg62F8Zg,Ctw-p_70utQ,Roxy Music - Virginia Plain (Live TOTP 1972),"""Virginia Plain"" is a song written in 1972 by Bryan Ferry.

Sam the Sham was known for his camp robe and turban and hauling his equipment in a 1952 Packard hearse with maroon velvet curtains. As the front man for The Pharaohs- he sang on several Top 40 hits in the mid-1960s- notably ""Wooly Bully"" and ""Li'l Red Riding Hood"".  After paying to record and press records to sell at gigs- Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs wound up with the Pen label in Memphis. There- they recorded their first and biggest hit- ""Wooly Bully""- a song about Sam's cat. ""Wooly Bully"" ended up selling 3 million copies and reaching No. 2 on the Billboard charts on 5 June 1965 at a time when American pop music charts were dominated by the British Invasion. It was awarded a gold disc.  Although ""Wooly Bully"" never reached #1- it lingered on the Billboard Hot 100 for 18 weeks- the most weeks for any single within the calendar year 1965- 14 of which were in the Top 40. It became the first Billboard ""Number One Record of the Year"" not to have topped a weekly Hot 100 and remained the only one for 35 years until Faith Hill's ""Breathe"" and Lifehouse's ""Hanging by a Moment"" in 2000 and 2001- respectively.  The Pharaohs' next releases -- ""Ju Ju Hand"" (#26 US) (#31 Can.) and ""Ring Dang Doo""- were minor successes. In late 1965- 11 months after ""Wooly Bully""- David A. Martin- Jerry Patterson- Ray Stinnett- and Butch Gibson left over a financial dispute. Sam's manager- Leonard Stogel- discovered Tony Gee & The Gypsys at the Metropole Cafe in Times Square- New York City. The band were Tony ""Butch"" Gerace (bass guitar and vocals) Frankie Carabetta (keyboards- saxophone and vocals) Billy Bennett (drums and percussion) and Andy Kuha (guitar and vocals). This new set of Pharaohs recorded ""Li'l Red Riding Hood"". On the Hot 100- ""Lil' Red Riding Hood"" began its two-week peak at #2 the week of August 6- 1966- just as another fairy tale title- ""The Pied Piper"" by Crispian St. Peters- was ending its three-week peak at #4. The track did even better by Cash Box Magazine's reckoning- reaching #1 the same week. It sold over one million copies- and was awarded a gold disc. It also reached #2 on the Canadian RPM Magazine charts August 22- 1966.  A series of mostly novelty tunes followed- all on the MGM label- keeping the group on the charts into 1967. Titles included ""The Hair On My Chinny Chin Chin"" (US #22- Canadian #13)- ""How Do You Catch A Girl"" (US #27- Canadian #12)- ""I Couldn't Spell !!*@!""- and the rather confusing lyrics of ""Oh That's Good- No That's Bad"" (US #54).",40,557,6,97818,nullSam The Sham and The Pharaohs,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7zMIjGNK0,2D7zMIjGNK0,Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs - Li'l Red Riding Hood (live- 2000),Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs performing their 1966 hit Li'l Red Riding Hood live in Belgium- December 9- 2000.,35,246,8,75404,nullSamantha Fox,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3nvEkd9XTc,f3nvEkd9XTc,Gunther & Samantha Fox - Touch Me Official Video (High Quality ),Touch Me by the sweden singer Gunther FEAT Samantha Fox.

Sammy sadly died January 4- 2013 at Gaston Memorial Hospital in Gastonia- North Carolina at the age of 66. Rest in Peace Sammy!  "" Sammy Johns (born 7 February 1946- Charlotte- North Carolina) is an American country singer-songwriter- best known for his million selling 1975 hit single- ""Chevy Van"". When he was nine years old- Johns' father presented him with a guitar- and by the time he was a teenager he had established his own band- the Devilles. The group performed in local clubs and recorded a few records on the Dixie record label. After a move to Atlanta- Georgia- he was given a recording contract in 1973. General Recording Corporation put out Johns' first solo record- ""Early Morning Love""- that year.  Although he wrote a number of hit songs for other artists- Johns is best remembered for the one he recorded himself- ""Chevy Van"". The single drove up to No. 5 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It remained in the chart for 20 weeks and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. on 4 May 1975. After his eponymous debut album on the GRC record label- which included ""Chevy Van""- the singer signed a deal in 1976 with Warner-Curb- which resulted in Johns working on the soundtrack to The Van. The 1982 New World Records single ""Falling for You"" came to the attention of Elektra- and the company took Johns on board and issued ""Love Me off the Road"" and ""Common Man"". When country artist John Conlee covered ""Common Man""- the single went gold and topped the charts. Conlee made the song his theme- and Johns continued writing songs for others.  Those who have recorded Johns' songs are Waylon Jennings- Sammy Kershaw- and Conway Twitty. In 1985- Jennings serenaded the Statue of Liberty with Johns' song ""America""- on a nationally broadcast event to mark the statue's restoration. The performance helped turn the single gold- and ""America"" was nominated for song of the year in country music circles. Johns' ""Desperado Love"" also brought Twitty his final gold record. Kershaw covered ""Chevy Van"" on his 1996 album Politics- Religion and Her.    ( wikipedia.org )   LYRICS: I gave a girl a ride in my wagon She crawled in and took control She was tired 'cause her mind was a-draggin' I said- get some sleep and dream of rock and roll  'Cause like a picture she was layin' there Moonlight dancin' off her hair She woke up and took me by the hand She's gonna love me in my Chevy van And that's all right with me  Her young face was like that of an angel Her long legs were tanned and brown Better keep your eyes on the road- son Better slow this vehicle down  'Cause like a princess she was layin' there Moonlight dancin' off her hair She woke up and took me by the hand She's gonna love me in my Chevy van And that's all right with me  I put her out in a town that was so small You could throw a rock from end to end A dirt-road main street- she walked off in bare feet It's a shame I won't be passin' through again  'Cause like a picture she was layin' there Moonlight dancin' off her hair She woke up and took me by the hand We made love in my Chevy van And that's all right with me  'Cause like a picture she was layin' there Moonlight dancin' off her hair She woke up and took me by the hand We made love in my Chevy van And that's all right with me",217,1462,33,288376,nullSammy Johns,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo8P82H8Ywk,Fo8P82H8Ywk,Sammy Johns Grand Ole Opry 6-20-09 Part 1,Sammy was ask to play the Grand Ole Opry last year!

No one's gonna cry on the very day you die You're a bully  (Solo)  It's 8 AM- the Hell I'm in!  Your voice is strong- now right the wrong!

Discover & Download More @ http://www.lsbrecords.com  Music video for Get The Party Started by Dame Shirley Bassey. This incredible recording can be found on the Get The Party Started album- which is out now. A new single with some fabulous dance mixes by NorthxNWest- Flip N Fill and Fugitive- as well as this music video is now also available.  Get The Party Started was produced by Catherine Feeney- Nikki Lamborn (Never The Bride)- Bob Kraushaar and Chuck Norman (NorthxNWest) with backing vocals by Rietta Austin- Margo Buchanan- Nikki Lamborn and Catherine Feeney. The music video was produced by Hera King and directed by Harvey and Carolyn (Crossroads Films).   This song was written by Linda Perry and originally recorded by Pink. Shirley sang it for the M&S Christmas TV ad- filmed in a spy movie style- and featured models Lizzy Jagger- Erin O'Connor- Laura Bailey- Noemie Lenoir and Twiggy as undercover agents on a secret mission to attend an exclusive DSB performance at a glamorous Christmas party.   It's difficult to know where to begin when it comes to describing Dame Shirley's incredible career which has spanned over 50 years. Having just celebrated her 70th birthday and a top ten UK album DSB proves age is no barrier for creating great music.   The original Welsh Diva and one of Wales' greatest musical exports- she stands tall alongside fellow Welsh singers Charlotte Church- Katherine Jenkins- Tom Jones- Cerys Matthews- Dorothy Squires- Bryn Terfel and Bonnie Tyler to name but a few.   During her career Shirley has also collaborated with Swiss band Yello on The Rhythm Divine. She sang with Chris Rea on his Ferrari inspired film- La Passione-  and probably most famously with The Propellerheads whose international club hit History Repeating propelled her into the spotlight. It featured on the soundtrack to the movie There's Something About Mary starring Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz and was the music behind a Jaguar car ad.   Shirley is the only singer to have recorded more than one James Bond Theme. She recorded three! Applauded by John Barry- Sean Connery and David Arnold- her hit records Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever ranked as the two best Bond themes ever in a recent poll- where she comfortably beat fellow Bond singers such as Tina Turner- Madonna- Paul McCartney- Matt Monro- Gladys Knight- Sheryl Crow- Lulu and Sheena Easton to the top spots. Casino Royale star Daniel Craig recently suggested DSB should record the next theme - after hearing The Living Tree you can't help but see he's got a point!   In recent years Shirley's recording of Diamonds Are Forever was sampled by hip-hop star Kanye West.  DSB has performed duets with acts such as Neil Diamond- Andy Williams- Alain Delon- Michael Ball- Bryn Terfel- Charles Aznavour- Jack Jones- Robert Goulet and Eydie Gorme and shared a stage with Ray Charles and Liza Minnelli on a successful tour.   In an episode of American Idol (the US equivalent to The X-Factor) contestants Jordin Sparks- Lakisha Jones and Melinda Doolittle all chose Shirley Bassey hits to impress judges Simon Cowell- Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul. Chris Sligh said ""Shirley Bassey rocks hard core"" and  presenter Ryan Seacrest proclaimed that it was Dame Shirley Bassey songs that ruled the night.",2505,11689,377,3161840,nullShirley Bassey,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3bWUL5gC80,s3bWUL5gC80,THE ROYAL VARIETY PERFORMANCE 2014 - SHIRLEY BASSEY,Shirley Bassey performs I'm Still Here and The Lady Is A Tramp- at The Royal Variety Performance 2014.,32,152,2,20692,nullShocking Blue,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPEhQugz-Ew,aPEhQugz-Ew,Shocking Blue - Venus (Official Video),"Official Video of ""Venus"" by Shocking Blue.

The group was named after Levay- ""Silver"" being Levay's nickname. Kunze had in the late 1960s been a pop lyricist who wrote protest songs in German; when these tunes went out of style- he began producing pop records and commercials.  Levay had developed a taste for American music while growing up in Yugoslavia- eventually becoming a music arranger and lyricist.    Using female session vocalists for their first recordings- they scored a successful single in the United Kingdom in 1975 with the song ""Save Me"". They were only a studio group- and realised then that they would need to find professional entertainers for presentation to the public.  They recruited vocalists Linda Thompson (real name Linda _belherr- who would be billed on her solo records as Linda G. Thompson- formerly a member of Les Humphries Singers)- Penny McLean (real name Gertrude Wirschinger) and Ramona Wulf (real name Ramona Kraft- born to a German mother and black American G.I. father).  Their first production was the minor successful single named ironically ""There Is Always Another Girl"".  As Silver Convention they scored two major U.S. hit singles. ""Fly- Robin- Fly-"" of which the complete lyrics consisted of only six distinct words (Fly- Robin- Up- To- The- Sky)- scored three weeks at #1 in late November and early December 1975- and won the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Instrumental Performance. It sold over one million copies- and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in December 1975.  Initially the song was titled ""Run- Rabbit- Run""- changed by the writers moments before the recording took place. Their next success ""Get Up And Boogie""- which also consisted of only six distinct words (Get- Up- And- Boogie- That's- Right) scored three weeks at #2 in June 1976.",124,732,14,261813,nullSimon and Garfunkel,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zLfCnGVeL4,4zLfCnGVeL4,The Sound of Silence (Original Version from 1964),"Lyrics: Hello darkness- my old friend   I've come to talk with you again   Because a vision softly creeping   Left its seeds while I was sleeping   And the vision that was planted in my brain   Still remains   Within the sound of silence     In restless dreams I walked alone   Narrow streets of cobblestone   'Neath the halo of a street lamp   I turned my collar to the cold and damp   When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light   That split the night   And touched the sound of silence     And in the naked light I saw   Ten thousand people maybe more   People talking without speaking   People hearing without listening   People writing songs that voices never shared   No one dared   Disturb the sound of silence     ""Fools-"" said I- ""you do not know   Silence like a cancer grows   Hear my words that I might teach you   Take my arms that I might reach you""   But my words like silent raindrops fell   And echoed in the wells of silence     And the people bowed and prayed   To the neon god they made   And the sign flashed out its warning   In the words that it was forming   And the sign said ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls   And tenement halls   And whispered in the sound of silence""    This is the original version from 1964 from the album ""Wednesday Morning- 3 AM.""

Best known for their work with Chic in the late '70s- Sister Sledge reached the height of their popularity during the disco era but had been recording since the early '70s and were still active in the late '90s. The group was formed in Philadelphia in 1971- when the sisters' ages ranged from 12 to 16- and they recorded their first single- ""Time Will Tell-"" for the Philly-based Money Back label. (For the first few years- the group called itself Sisters Sledge.)    In 1972- Sister Sledge signed with Atco and recorded its second single- ""Weatherman-"" which was followed by the Jackson 5-like ""Mama Never Told Me"" in 1973. It wasn't until 1979- when Chic leaders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards produced We Are Family- that Sister Sledge really exploded commercially. ""He's the Greatest Dancer"" and We Are Family's title song both soared to number one on the R&B charts.",1340,8070,156,3058405,nullSister Sledge,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDSSGyPurmE,PDSSGyPurmE,Sister Sledge - We Are Family (Live) (1980),Sister Sledge.

Stevie Wonder has remained one of the truly essential artists of our lifetime and at age 58, Stevie Wonder remains among the most visionary and influential singers, songwriters, musicians and producers in music history. Winner of 25 Grammy Awards including a Lifetime Achievement Award, he was honoured with an induction into the Rock and Roll hall of Fame in 1989 and also received and Academy Award in 1984 for ""I Just Called To Say I Love You"" from the movie, ""The Woman in Red"". He has also had an astonishing 32 #1 singles and worldwide sales in excess of 100 million. Cited by a new generation of urban and hip hop artists as one of today's seminal and cultural influences. Wonder is also recognized for putting a human face on countless social issues. A tireless champion for political and social justice. Wonder was a pre-eminent force behind the Martin Luther King holiday and USA for Africa, as well as helping to raise awareness about the AIDs epidemic and the scourge of Apartheid in South Africa. A key figure supporting Obama's Presidential campaign, Stevie performed ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours"" to a crowd of 85,000 at Denver, Colorado's Invesco Field, just prior to then-Senator Barack H. Obama's nomination acceptance address at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

(C) 1992 A&M Records. Official Video Remastered- Widescreen- 5.1  StingVEVO:http://www.youtube.com/user/StingVEVO/videos StingOfficialSite:http://www.sting.com/ StingLYRICS:http://www.azlyrics.com/s/sting.html  Ten Summoner's Tales is the fourth solo studio album by the rock musician Sting. The title is a combined pun of his family name- Sumner- and a character in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales- the summoner. Released in 1993- it explores themes of love and morality in a noticeably upbeat mood compared to his previous release- the introspective The Soul Cages released in 1991 after the loss of both his parents in 1987. The backing track of ""Shape of My Heart"" was used- in a slightly altered way- by rapper Nas on his song ""The Message"" on the 1996 album It Was Written. In the later 1990s and the 2000s- it became a popular sample in R&B and hip hop songs- possibly inspired by Nas' usage. It has been sampled or interpolated in the following: ""Take Him Back"" by Monica from the 1998 album The Boy Is Mine ""Release Me"" by Blaque from the 1999 album Blaque ""Never Let Go"" by Hikaru Utada from the 1999 album First Love (re-recorded instrumental) ""Emotional"" by Carl Thomas from the 2000 album Emotional ""Ways of the World"" by Lil' Zane from the 2000 album Young World: The Future Some live renditions of the 2001 song ""Je Moest Waarschijnlijk Gaan"" by Brainpower ""Rise & Fall"" by Craig David from the 2002 album Slicker Than Your Average (re-recorded instrumentals- and chorus sung- with new lyrics- by Sting) ""Shape"" by the Sugababes from the 2002 album Angels with Dirty Faces (included the original chorus vocals as well as the song's B-section) ""Ways to Avoid the Sun"" by Rain (2003) has a similar melody- which was probably inspired by this song. ""I Crave You"" by Shontelle from the 2008 album Shontelligence ""For My Soldiers"" by Pastor Troy from the 2008 album Attitude Adjuster (included some of the song's original chorus) The song has also been covered by several artists: Ann-Margret on the soundtrack to the 1996 TV movie Blue Rodeo Lee Ritenour- featuring Steve Lukather and Andy McKee- on the 2010 album 6 String Theory Vybz Kartel  ""Shape Of My Heart""  He deals the cards as a meditation And those he plays never suspect He doesn't play for the money he wins He don't play for respect  He deals the cards to find the answer The sacred geometry of chance [Studio version:] The hidden law of a probable outcome [Live version:] The hidden laws of a probable outcome The numbers lead a dance  I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart  He may play the Jack of diamonds He may lay the Queen of spades He may conceal a King in his hand While the memory of it fades  I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart That's not the shape- the shape of my heart  And if I told you that I loved you You'd maybe think there's something wrong I'm not a man of too many faces The mask I wear is one  But those who speak know nothing And find out to their cost Like those who curse their luck in too many places And those who fear a loss  I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart That's not the shape of my heart That's not the shape- the shape of my heart",33,110,1,13962,nullSting,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0sQcC4Duc0,IPoX4Lu9GeA,Sting - Fragile - LIVE IN BERLIN 2010 (HD),"Sting - Live in Berlin 2010 - Fragile - with the Royal Philharmonic OrchestraVideo from ""Live in Berlin"" (DVD) - Sting, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, director Steven Mercurio - Deutsche Grammophon - 2010",676,6983,98,1797566,nullStrawberry Alarm Clock,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYLz63csS0,qhYLz63csS0,Strawberry Alarm Clock - Incense And Peppermints,this is my 3rd shairedaccount that i've made.i have finally learned from the first two(shairedaccount and shairedaccount41)that if i have all of my videos on one account that they will get suspended so i will only put four videos per shairedaccount    here is a link to ShairedAccount41A  http://www.youtube.com/shairedaccount41a    please subscribe!

Mr. Wood asked Tab if he would like to make a record. Tab confessed that he was not really a singer- but Randy explained that you do not have to be a great singer to make a good record. On Saturday- December 15- 1956 - at Ryder Sound on Santa Monica Blvd. in Hollywood - Tab had his first recording session.  Tab explained in his autobiography that Randy hired ""some"" singers to harmonize with him - those singers turned out to be The Jordanaires - Elvis' backup group. ""Man- this was serious stuff.  I was starting to feel the pressure."" Tab confessed. After a few takes- his nerves settled down and the 11th take was ""it"". When - later in the week - Tab heard his record on the radio - he himself had to admit that ""I'll be damned - ""Young Love"" sounded pretty good"". Randy rushed Tab back into the studio to make some additional songs. However- when a Warner Bros. attorney heard ""Young Love"" on the radio - which was becoming a smash hit - things hit the fan. Tab Hunter was under contract to Warner Bros. for EVERYTHING - not only motion pictures. ""Jack Warner may have magnanimously declined to pass judgment on my personal life- but if there was a buck to be made - he OWNED me.""  By February 2- 1957- when the record reached #4 on the charts- a deal was cut whereupon Dot had to pay Warner Bros. a hefty compensation for any Tab Hunter record in release. When the studio's lawyers found out that Randy had enough songs for an LP - they barred Dot from releasing anything beyond singles that had already been shipped. ""Randy Wood was holding orders for 100-000 albums. He was sitting on a gold mine- but Warner Bros. had no intention of letting him- or me- profit from a singing voice IT owned. At first I brushed it off- like I usually did. I'd been carried away by my enthusiasm and my naivete- resulting in a guileless breach of contract. Big deal. Then- Randy Wood handed me my first ""Young Love"" royalty check. I don't recall the total- but I remember precisely the Internal Revenue Service's cut - $56-000. That was just the taxes! I was making WAY more money as a pop singer than as a contract player at Warner Bros. That was a real eye-opener.""  In an indirect way- Tab's recording success at Dot was an impetus for Warner Bros. to start their own records label - which later on- Tab Hunter wound up recording for (which hopefully made Jack Warner very happy).  Tab's record of ""Young Love"" was a cover of Sonny James on Capitol. In 1966- Lesley Gore recorded her own version of ""Young Love"" on Mercury Records which was a moderate hit for her.

Says Tikaram on the single: ""I've always wanted to write a song like 'Dust On My Shoes'- which is a simple freedom song.  The word 'freedom' becomes more and more important to all of us - in every choice- every political & moral decision and the attempt to live in a free way I find very moving. Hopefully- on the album you hear it in the playing- too!!""  ""Dust On My Shoes"" is already available as a digital single and is a warm soul record- enhanced by the evocative scenery of New York City- where the video was shot in May.  A good buzz is building at radio for the ""return"" of lovely Tanita- and the artist is preparing to hit stages again in the course of the album campaign: ""I cant wait to get out there and start playing the new songs to everyone!""  The album ""Can't Go Back"" will feature 10 brand new songs.

""Head Over Heels"" was the third single released from the album and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was one of the top selling albums of the decade peaking at number 1 in the US- and has been included in the book ""1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die"". Slant Magazine listed the album at #95 on its list of ""Best Albums of the 1980s"". TFF and this song are still referenced in pop culture on TV shows like ""Psych"" and in the cult film Donnie Darko. I remember when I saw the video for the first time I was disappointed because the audio quality was very poor. So I replaced the original track with a rip from the 45RPM vinyl single and wow what a difference! It truly sounds like the way it should - even better than the CD. (audiophile) TRIVIA: The album title was derived from the 1976 television film Sybil about a woman with multiple personality disorder who only feels safe when she is sitting in her analyst's ""big chair"".  More info from TFF fan Kristin G. (Thanks Kristin!): Song Versions ""Head over Heels"" has seen only three official remixes since its release.  The 12"" version was titled the ""Preacher Mix"" and is an extended remix of the entire ""Broken/Head Over Heels/Broken"" medley. The mix was done by producer Chris Hughes and features an unusual spoken word intro in which Roland Orzabal recites lyrics from the song ""I Believe"" in the style of a preacher. This mix contains the only released studio recording of the ""Broken"" reprise (the version on the Songs from the Big Chair album is a live recording). The sung vocals from the album version of ""Broken"" are completely absent- as is the lead guitar line. The 7"" remix was done by David Bascombe and notably ends in a cold stop after the ""time flies"" lyric- instead of the segue into the reprise of ""Broken"" found on the album. There is also a unique radio-only version which was issued on a double A-side single featuring the regular single mix on the other side. This was issued to radio stations for promotion only and has the catalog number IDEDJ 10. The radio mix is noticeably different to the regular single version in that it omits the flanging effects from the drum fill after the second chorus and the closing ""time flies"" vocals. Whereas the regular single credits the remix to Dave Bascombe- the radio version simply credits Chris Hughes as producer. This version of the single does not include ""When In Love With A Blind Man"" and has blue coloured injection molded labels.""  Song Meaning: ""It is basically a romantic love song and one of the most simple tracks that Tears for Fears have ever recorded. It is a romance song that goes a bit perverse at the end.""  ~Roland Orzabal  Music Video ""The music video for ""Head over Heels""- filmed in June 1985- was the fourth Tears for Fears clip directed by famed music video producer Nigel Dick.""  Lyrics ""Head Over Heels"" by Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith I wanted to be with you alone And talk about the weather But traditions I can trace against the child in your face Won't escape my attention You keep your distance with a system of touch And gentle persuasion I'm lost in admiration could I need you this much Oh- you're wasting my time You're just- just wasting time  Something happens and I'm head over heels I never find out till I'm head over heels Something happens and I'm head over heels Ah don't take my heart Don't break my heart Don't throw it away  I made a fire and watching burn Thought of your future With one foot in the past now just how long will it last No no no have you no ambition My mother and my brothers used to breathe in clean in air And dreaming I'm a doctor It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand Oh I feel so...  Something happens and I'm head over heels I never find out till I'm head over heels Something happens and I'm head over heels Ah don't take my heart Don't break my heart Don't throw it away  And this my four leaf clover I'm on the line- one open mind This is my four leaf clover  La la la la la la la la la la  In my mind's eye One little boy- one little man Funny how... time flies",521,1926,28,333213,nullTears For Fears,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8L_hLS21cw,g589w9_OWj4,Tears for Fears - Everybody Wants to Rule the World (Live),"Tears for Fears performing ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" Live at Night of the Proms (Belgium/France, 2007).",51,269,8,68679,nullTechnotronic,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EcjWd-O4jI,9EcjWd-O4jI,Technotronic - Pump Up The Jam,Music video by Technotronic performing Pump Up The Jam.

The performance took place in front of 2-500 members of The Beatles' Northern Area Fan Club- between 3.45 and 4.30pm. It was filmed in its entirety by the BBC- and 30 minutes were broadcast that evening from 8.10pm to 8.40pm during a special programme entitled It's The Beatles.  The group played a short version of From Me To You- followed by I Saw Her Standing There- All My Loving- Roll Over Beethoven- Boys- Till There Was You- She Loves You- This Boy- I Want To Hold Your Hand- Money (That's What I Want)- Twist And Shout- and another version of From Me To You.  Technical problems and lack of rehearsal times meant the sound balance for the concert recording was sub-standard. Both The Beatles and senior figures at the BBC later expressed concern at the often embarrassing nature of the footage- which included the absence of Ringo vocals during Boys and the director focusing on the wrong members of the group during key moments.  After the concert the BBC also recorded a two-minute interview with the group to use on the Christmas Day edition of Top Of The Pops.  The Beatles then made the short journey to the nearby Odeon Cinema on London Road where they gave two evening concerts. The police closed Pudsey Street to the public to allow the group to reach the venue unhindered.,1740,7650,246,2557212,nullThe Bellamy Brothers,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7DniRWRA7s,Q7DniRWRA7s,"The Bellamy Brothers - ""Boobs""","Our favorite ""heterosexual- white boy- Methodists"" are at it again with this summertime favorite.

""Kind of a Drag"" is a song written by Jim Holvay and recorded by The Buckinghams. The single reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in February 1967- becoming the first #1 single within the new calendar year and remaining in the top position for two weeks. It was the first of the band's three Top 10 hits in 1967.  The song was written by Chicago-based songwriter Jim Holvay- who had been performing with a group called The Mob- and spent two weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1967. It sold over one million copies- and was awarded a gold disc. The co-producers of ""Kind of a Drag"" were the band's first personal manager Carl Bonafede and big band leader Dan Belloc- owner of the Holiday Ballroom in Chicago. The arranger of the horn sound was Frank Tesinsky. The engineer at the first recording sessions held at Chess Records in Chicago was Ron Malo. Following this- the band's debut album- also entitled Kind of a Drag- was released and featured the band's early recordings. The Buckinghams are an American Sunshine Pop band from Chicago- Illinois. They formed in 1966- and went on to become one of the top selling acts of 1967. The band dissolved in 1970- but reformed in 1980 and as of 2013 they continue to tour throughout the United States. The Buckinghams were part of the Happy Together '85 Tour- along with The Turtles- The Grass Roots- and Gary Lewis and the Playboys. The Buckinghams were one of the first groups to initiate ""Meet and Greets"" after concerts where Carl Giammarese and Nick Fortuna meet the fans and sign autographs after each show. That quickly caught on with other classic rock bands- who also started staying to meet the fans after shows.""

Lyrics by magistrix.de:  Down in Mexicali There's a crazy little place that I know Where the drinks are hotter than the chili sauce And the boss is a cat named Joe  He wears a red bandana- plays a blues pianna In a honky-tonk- down in Mexico He wears a purple sash- and a black moustache In a honky-tonk- down in Mexico  Well- the first time that I saw him He was sittin' on a piano stool I said ""Tell me dad- when does the fun begin?"" He just winked his eye and said ""Man- be cool.""  He wears a red bandana- plays a blues pianna In a honky-tonk- down in Mexico He wears a purple sash- and a black moustache In a honky-tonk- down in Mexico  All of a sudden in walks this chick Joe starts playing on a Latin kick Around her waist she wore three fishnets She started dancin' with the castanets I didn't know just what to expect She threw her arms around my neck We started dancin' all around the floor And then she did a dance I never saw before.  So if you're south of the border I mean down in Mexico And you wanna get straight- Man- don't hesitate Just look up a cat named Joe.  He wears a red bandana- plays a blues pianna In a honky-tonk- down in Mexico He wears a purple sash- and a black moustache In a honky-tonk- down in Mexico  Yeah- como est usted senorita Come with me to the border- south of the border- that is In Mexico- yeah in Mexico You can get your kicks in Mexico Come with me baby- come with me- come with me- crazy- yeah",660,11720,189,2542532,nullThe Coasters,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSkFP2hD3k4,LSkFP2hD3k4,The Coasters - Poison Ivy [Live Concert],The Coasters - Poison Ivy [Live Concert],6,21,0,6244,nullThe Crickets,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBi5svnYgA,bGBi5svnYgA,"The Crickets  T-Shirt ""Official"" Video","This video posted for entertainment- educational purposes only.

All three young ladies were from New Orleans- as was producer and singer Joe Jones- who discovered the talented threesome and took them to New York.   The trio was almost known as the Meltones -- or worse- Little Miss and the Muffets -- but the name Dixie Cups was settled on by 1964. That was the year the girls recorded the well-remembered song ""Chapel of Love"" on the Red Bird Records label. The number was written by Phil Spector- Ellie Greenwich- and Jeff Barry- and intended to be released by the Ronettes- Darlene Love- or the Crystals. That one single was enough to carry the group into music history. It became the Dixie Cups' biggest success- a million-seller- and a worldwide hit. A few other hits followed through 1964 and into 1965- like ""You Should Have Seen the Way He Looked at Me-"" ""Little Bell-"" ""Iko Iko-"" and ""People Say."" A year later- Red Bird Records was out of the picture. The trio moved to ABC-Paramount- but there were no more hits- and 1966 saw the end of the Dixie Cups. There had been other singles- like ""Gee the Moon Is Shining Bright"" and ""Girls Can Tell-"" but there weren't enough fans to back the releases.   In 1974- Rosa Lee and her sister Barbara Ann left New York behind to return to New Orleans and found work as models for awhile. When the sisters began to sing and tour again- their cousin Joan Marie declined to join in- so her spot was filled by Dale Mickle. ~ Charlotte Dillon- All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

They recorded from 1963 through 1975- and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003. Their emotive vocal stylings were sometimes dubbed ""blue-eyed soul"". Medley and Hatfield both possessed exceptional vocal talent- with range- control and tone that helped them create a strong and distinct duet sound and also to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his deep- soulful bass-baritone- with Hatfield taking the higher register vocals with his soaring tenor.  They adopted their name in 1962 while performing together in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called The Paramours- which featured John Wimber- one of the founders of the Vineyard Movement- on keyboards. At the end of one particular performance- a black Marine in the audience shouted- ""That was righteous- brothers!""- prompting the pair to adopt the name when they embarked on a career as a duo.

Group member Erik Darling recruited two friends to record a folk version of ""Walk Right In"" after hearing the original Cannon recording. Darling wanted the record to have a distinctive sound- so he and group member Bill Svanoe both played twelve string guitars on the song- although they had some difficulty in acquiring the instruments. Darling is quoted as saying that prior to the making of this record- ""you couldn't buy a 12-string guitar...I ordered one from the Gibson Company- but in order to record [the song] with two 12-strings- we had to wait for the company to build a second one for Bill!"".",61,273,5,67881,nullThe Rooftop Singers,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxrNME-C8rI,OxrNME-C8rI,Rooftop Singers - Tom Cat (Live),Music video by Rooftop Singers performing Tom Cat (Live).,0,0,0,88,nullThe Shirelles,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQlImg2bm28,WQlImg2bm28,The Shirelles - Mamma Said,"*STEREO*.

""Hot Line"" was another Top Ten on both lists in 1976- and their second biggest single. They scored another Top 20 R&B single on Casablanca in 1978- ""Don't Stop- Get Off-"" but the charming qualities of their earlier material seemed more calculated.

A Grammy winning recording and a chart topping sensation- 'Don't Leave Me This Way' by Thelma Houston was one of 1977's biggest hits. The original album version is the one posted here- and it gives me great pleasure to create a clip for the 5.40 duration mix of the disco track. An extra two minutes of the song to love- this song has been an enduring favourite of mine - just as wonderful today as it was 36 years ago! Many other artists have memorialised this Motown song- but arguably Thelma's is the finest.   Winning the Grammy for Best  R&B Female Vocal Performance in 1977- 'Don't Leave Me This Way' topped the American charts- while topping several states here in Oz- it managed a #6 national spot on the Top 40- and was selling for more than 5 months. Interestingly- the original version by Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes- although recorded two years earlier- beat Thelma's version into the British charts by 4 weeks- and achieved a Top 5- while her version stalled at #13. In Australia- the reverse order occurred- and the 1975 track could only manage to climb to #78 nationally.   Enjoy one of the great disco records of all time!,82,612,10,126820,nullThelma Houston,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ59Wtp5boc,sQ59Wtp5boc,THELMA HOUSTON LIVE - DON'T LEAVE ME THIS WAY,2003,74,244,4,84683,nullThin Lizzy,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyQ-tScuzwM,wyQ-tScuzwM,Thin Lizzy - Whiskey In The Jar (official music video),,449,3827,79,676446,nullThin Lizzy,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC6Cgb8nHwk,KmBy48YJKd4,Thin Lizzy - Jailbreak Live HQ,Thin Lizzy - Jailbreak Live HQ,290,902,21,239403,nullThird Eye Blind,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyjTrwOMSO4,MyjTrwOMSO4,Third Eye Blind - Semi-Charmed Life (HQ) [Official],"Semi-Charmed Life is a song by American alternative rock band Third Eye Blind. It was released in June 1997 as the first single from their self-titled debut album- released in 1997. It was a major hit of the 1990s- reaching number four in the U.S.-[1] number one on the Modern Rock Tracks and the Top 40 in the UK. Furthermore- it has had a pervasive cultural impact- being featured in numerous movie soundtracks. VH1 has named the song as the 34th best of the 1990s.  According to lead singer Stephan Jenkins- the song was meant as a response to Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side"" but from a San Francisco perspective.[3] The style of the song reflects changes that were occurring in the San Francisco music scene- particularly a growing interest in hip-hop.",1246,11481,228,2521926,nullThird Eye Blind,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfl5_N-TLiw,Sfl5_N-TLiw,Third Eye Blind Hows it gonna be live on Jay Leno 1998,Kevin Cadogan working his magic!,36,98,4,31844,nullThomas Dolby,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FIMvSp01C8,#NAME?,Thomas Dolby - She Blinded Me With Science,"Thomas Dolby - She Blinded Me With Science.

Year: 1967 ... This was recorded from my personal record collection.,51,372,5,71285,nullTommy Boyce and Bobby Hart,video,live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnlBXLHd08,mfnlBXLHd08,Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart - I Wonder What She's Doing Tonight,"Boyce & Hart- the songwriting and performing team of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart- are most famous for writing several of the Monkees' big hits- including ""Last Train to Clarksville-"" ""Valleri-"" and ""(I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone."" Together and separately- they also wrote or contributed to hits by several other acts in the 1960s- including Freddy Cannon- Curtis Lee- Little Anthony & the Imperials- and Jay & the Americans. In 1967 they began recording on their own as a duo- landing a Top Ten hit the same year with ""I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite."" Boyce & Hart were a West Coast equivalent to the kind of craftsmanship and methodology espoused by Brill Building songwriting teams- although their material was less meaningful and enduring than Goffin-King's or Barry-Greenwich's. They emphasized bright- happy- AM radio melodies with room for lots of vocal harmonies- an appropriate vibe for the Monkees and other acts; it was typical of the L.A. late-'60s pop/rock that would retroactively be dubbed ""sunshine pop.""   Boyce- the older of the pair- had a history that long predated the Monkees- co-writing a Top Ten hit for Fats Domino in 1959 (""Be My Guest""). Around the early '60s- he met Hart and the pair spent some time in New York in the mid-'60s- where they (with Wes Farrell) wrote the Jay & the Americans hit ""Come a Little Bit Closer."" Throughout the first half of the 1960s Boyce wrote or helped write material without any Hart involvement- including hits by Cannon (""Action"") and Lee (""Pretty Little Angel Eyes"")- while Hart had a piece of the songwriting for Little Anthony & the Imperials' ""Hurt So Bad."" It wasn't until 1965 that the Boyce-Hart partnership took off in earnest- as they were signed to the Screen Gems publishing company. They knocked off some energetic pop/rockers that were recorded by bands like Paul Revere & the Raiders (""[I'm Not Your] Stepping Stone"") and the Leaves (""Words"")- as well as the theme for the soap opera Days of Our Lives.   They found themselves in the right place at the right time when they were commissioned to write a few songs for the pilot episode of The Monkees. Because the Monkees were going to be on TV every week- they needed a steady supply of songs fast- which helped assure that Boyce & Hart placed many of their tunes with the group. These included not only a few hits- but also many album tracks; about half the songs on the Monkees' first album were Boyce-Hart tunes. The Monkees even redid some Boyce-Hart songs- such as ""(I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone-"" ""Words-"" and ""Tomorrow's Gonna Be Another Day.""   Boyce & Hart's material may not have been the first choice of what the group- and specifically their most experienced songwriter- Mike Nesmith- wanted to record. But Boyce-Hart's knack for AM-friendly pop hooks and chipper- just-this-side-of-bubblegum arrangements were very much in tune with the image projected by the group on their show. Boyce & Hart were also involved in the Monkees' first two albums as producers- a role they returned to on the Monkees' albums in 1969 and 1970.   Starting in 1967- Boyce & Hart also recorded on their own for A&M Records. Aside from ""I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite-"" however- none of their efforts made the Top 20 or came close to that song in quality- although ""Alice Long (You're Still My Favorite Girlfriend)"" and ""Out & About"" both made the Top 40 and ""We're All Going to the Same Place"" and ""Goodbye Baby"" charted in lower positions. Boyce & Hart split up- both as songwriters and performers- at the end of the 1960s- although they teamed up with ex-Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones to perform and record for a while in the mid-'70s as Dolenz- Jones- Boyce & Hart. Boyce committed suicide in November 1994 after a lengthy struggle with illness and depression.  ~ Richie Unterberger- All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels- Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Yet anyone seeing this 2002 live performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival- having witnessed the band in the early days on their first national tour with the Pretenders- would be astonished at their transformation from diffident musicians to consummate showmen. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Subscribe to our channel for more Live Music videos: http://bit.ly/1y4lYzJ  Discover iConcerts official website: http://www.iconcerts.com  Get iConcerts on all your screens: - iOS: http://bit.ly/1y4if5b - Android: http://bit.ly/1y4in4B - Smart TV: http://bit.ly/1zIpGkC - W8: http://bit.ly/1yaHGr1  Follow us on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1wcC3YD,235,2292,42,750176,nullUgly Kid Joe,video,studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B32yjbCSVpU,B32yjbCSVpU,Ugly Kid Joe - Cats In The Cradle,Music video by Ugly Kid Joe performing Cats In The Cradle.

In January 2011- the band returned to the studio to record _Into the Wild” and the band once again returned to the road for a worldwide tour. Playing to nearly 150-000 people- in Eastern Europe- Australia- Japan- and America and playing in 58 different countries in total. On March 4th 2014- Uriah Heep played in front of their _home” audience in London and performed an amazing show which was recorded in HD for a release in Double cd/dvd and- for the first time- on Blu-Ray.  _Recording a live DVD in London at Koko's was just fantastic. Our fans travelled from all over the world to be there- and be part of this magic night-” says Mick Box. _This added so much to the atmosphere- and thankfully it was captured on camera. We debuted two songs from our new CD- 'Outsider-' that night- and the reaction was just incredible- proving that we have the best fans in the world.”  Originally founded by vocalist David Byron and guitarist Mick Box- Uriah Heep has been through an incredible number of permutations- with Mick Box always at the helm. Long standing keyboard player Phil Lanzon and vocalist Bernie Shaw were recruited nearly 30 years ago in 1986. Drummer Russell Gilbrook who has now been with the band 7 years- has recorded studio albums _Wake the Sleeper”- _Into the Wild” & _Outsider”. _Wake the Sleeper” heralded an exciting new phase for the band- taking Heepês classic sound right into the future. The band celebrated its 40th anniversary with an aptly titled greatest hits re-recordings album called _Celebration”. Dave Rimmer- who had been standing in for Trevor Bolder (ex-David Bowie's Spiders From Mars)- continues as the bassist- with the bandês diary for the foreseeable future as full as ever.  _Live at Koko- London 2014” track listing includes: CD1 : Against The Odds; Overload; Traveller In Time; Sunrise; Stealinê; Iêm Ready; Between Two Worlds; Canêt Take That Away; One Minute; Nail On The Head.

(*) Bonus Track Available only on the Deluxe Edition  BETTER DAYS COMIN' is the highly anticipated new album from WINGER! Brand new studio album from these classic hard rockers. Once again Winger offers an exciting mixture of the melodic and commercial approach of their first two albums with the more technical and almost progressive rock feel of such albums as ""Pull"" or ""IV"".    ""Better Days Comin'"" is a logical follow up to the critically acclaimed ""Karma""- which was hailed as one of the band's best releases ever. ""Better Days Comin'"" is an amazing new record where the four band members: Kip Winger (ex-Alice Cooper)- Reb Beach (Whitesnake)- Rod Morgenstein (Dixie Dregs- Steve Morse) and John Roth (Starship- Giant) shine with an intense display of incredible instrumental and vocal prowess. A fine set of hard rock songs with an uncanny sense of melody.    Deluxe edition includes one audio bonus track and a DVD including a documentary ""Making of the album"" and two videoclips.  Look out for WINGER tour dates in the spring and summer in support of the new album!

Beg to hear your wonderous stories.  He spoke of lands not far or lands they were in his mind. Of fusion captured high where reason captured his time. In no time at all he took me to the gate. In haste I quickly checked the time. If I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories. Had to hear your wonderous stories.  Hearing... Hearing your wonderous stories.  It is no lie I can see deeply into the future. Imagine everything you're close and were you there to stand So cautiously at first and then so high. As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky.
